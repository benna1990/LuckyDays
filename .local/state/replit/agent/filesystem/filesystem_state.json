This allows you\n  to utilize other PSR-7 compatible libraries with Guzzle.\n- Supports PSR-18 allowing interoperability between other PSR-18 HTTP Clients.\n- Abstracts away the underlying HTTP transport, allowing you to write\n  environment and transport agnostic code; i.e., no hard dependency on cURL,\n  PHP streams, sockets, or non-blocking event loops.\n- Middleware system allows you to augment and compose client behavior.\n\n```php\n$client = new \\GuzzleHttp\\Client();\n$response = $client->request('GET', 'https://api.github.com/repos/guzzle/guzzle');\n\necho $response->getStatusCode(); // 200\necho $response->getHeaderLine('content-type'); // 'application/json; charset=utf8'\necho $response->getBody(); // '{\"id\": 1420053, \"name\": \"guzzle\", ...}'\n\n// Send an asynchronous request.\n$request = new \\GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Request('GET', 'http://httpbin.org');\n$promise = $client->sendAsync($request)->then(function ($response) {\n    echo 'I completed!

Above all listen to me.\n```\n\n\n## BufferStream\n\n`GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\BufferStream`\n\nProvides a buffer stream that can be written to fill a buffer, and read\nfrom to remove bytes from the buffer.\n\nThis stream returns a \"hwm\" metadata value that tells upstream consumers\nwhat the configured high water mark of the stream is, or the maximum\npreferred size of the buffer.\n\n```php\nuse GuzzleHttp\\Psr7;\n\n// When more than 1024 bytes are in the buffer, it will begin returning\n// false to writes. This is an indication that writers should slow down.\n$buffer = new Psr7\\BufferStream(1024);\n```\n\n\n## CachingStream\n\nThe CachingStream is used to allow seeking over previously read bytes on\nnon-seekable streams. This can be useful when transferring a non-seekable\nentity body fails due to needing to rewind the stream (for example, resulting\nfrom a redirect). Data that is read from the remote stream will be buffered in\na PHP temp stream so that previously read bytes are cached first in memory,\nthen on disk.\n\n```php\nuse GuzzleHttp\\Psr7;\n\n$original = Psr7\\Utils::streamFor(fopen('http://www.google.com', 'r'));\n$stream = new Psr7\\CachingStream($original);\n\n$stream->read(1024);\necho $stream->tell();\n// 1024\n\n$stream->seek(0);\necho $stream->tell();\n// 0\n```\n\n\n## DroppingStream\n\n`GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\DroppingStream`\n\nStream decorator that begins dropping data once the size of the underlying\nstream becomes too full.\n\n```php\nuse GuzzleHttp\\Psr7;\n\n// Create an empty stream\n$stream = Psr7\\Utils::streamFor();\n\n// Start dropping data when the stream has more than 10 bytes\n$dropping = new Psr7\\DroppingStream($stream, 10);\n\n$dropping->write('01234567890123456789');\necho $stream; // 0123456789\n```\n\n\n## FnStream\n\n`GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\FnStream`\n\nCompose stream implementations based on a hash of functions.\n\nAllows for easy testing and extension of a provided stream without needing\nto create a concrete class for a simple extension point.\n\n```php\n\nuse GuzzleHttp\\Psr7;\n\n$stream = Psr7\\Utils::streamFor('hi');\n$fnStream = Psr7\\FnStream::decorate($stream, [\n    'rewind' => function () use ($stream) {\n        echo 'About to rewind - ';\n        $stream->rewind();\n        echo 'rewound!';\n    }\n]);\n\n$fnStream->rewind();\n// Outputs: About to rewind - rewound!\n```\n\n\n## InflateStream\n\n`GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\InflateStream`\n\nUses PHP's zlib.inflate filter to inflate zlib (HTTP deflate, RFC1950) or gzipped (RFC1952) content.\n\nThis stream decorator converts the provided stream to a PHP stream resource,\nthen appends the zlib.inflate filter. The stream is then converted back\nto a Guzzle stream resource to be used as a Guzzle stream.\n\n\n## LazyOpenStream\n\n`GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\LazyOpenStream`\n\nLazily reads or writes to a file that is opened only after an IO operation\ntake place on the stream.\n\n```php\nuse GuzzleHttp\\Psr7;\n\n$stream = new Psr7\\LazyOpenStream('/path/to/file', 'r');\n// The file has not yet been opened...\n\necho $stream->read(10);\n// The file is opened and read from only when needed.\n```\n\n\n## LimitStream\n\n`GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\LimitStream`\n\nLimitStream can be used to read a subset or slice of an existing stream object.\nThis can be useful for breaking a large file into smaller pieces to be sent in\nchunks (e.g. Amazon S3's multipart upload API).\n\n```php\nuse GuzzleHttp\\Psr7;\n\n$original = Psr7\\Utils::streamFor(fopen('/tmp/test.txt', 'r+'));\necho $original->getSize();\n// >>> 1048576\n\n// Limit the size of the body to 1024 bytes and start reading from byte 2048\n$stream = new Psr7\\LimitStream($original, 1024, 2048);\necho $stream->getSize();\n// >>> 1024\necho $stream->tell();\n// >>> 0\n```\n\n\n## MultipartStream\n\n`GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\MultipartStream`\n\nStream that when read returns bytes for a streaming multipart or\nmultipart/form-data stream.\n\n\n## NoSeekStream\n\n`GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\NoSeekStream`\n\nNoSeekStream wraps a stream and does not allow seeking.\n\n```php\nuse GuzzleHttp\\Psr7;\n\n$original = Psr7\\Utils::streamFor('foo');\n$noSeek = new Psr7\\NoSeekStream($original);\n\necho $noSeek->read(3);\n// foo\nvar_export($noSeek->isSeekable());\n// false\n$noSeek->seek(0);\nvar_export($noSeek->read(3));\n// NULL\n```\n\n\n## PumpStream\n\n`GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\PumpStream`\n\nProvides a read only stream that pumps data from a PHP callable.\n\nWhen invoking the provided callable, the PumpStream will pass the amount of\ndata requested to read to the callable. The callable can choose to ignore\nthis value and return fewer or more bytes than requested. Any extra data\nreturned by the provided callable is buffered internally until drained using\nthe read() function of the PumpStream. The provided callable MUST return\nfalse when there is no more data to read.\n\n\n## Implementing stream decorators\n\nCreating a stream decorator is very easy thanks to the\n`GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\StreamDecoratorTrait`. This trait provides methods that\nimplement `Psr\\Http\\Message\\StreamInterface` by proxying to an underlying\nstream. Just `use` the `StreamDecoratorTrait` and implement your custom\nmethods.\n\nFor example, let's say we wanted to call a specific function each time the last\nbyte is read from a stream. This could be implemented by overriding the\n`read()` method.\n\n```php\nuse Psr\\Http\\Message\\StreamInterface;\nuse GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\StreamDecoratorTrait;\n\nclass EofCallbackStream implements StreamInterface\n{\n    use StreamDecoratorTrait;\n\n    private $callback;\n\n    private $stream;\n\n    public function __construct(StreamInterface $stream, callable $cb)\n    {\n        $this->stream = $stream;\n        $this->callback = $cb;\n    }\n\n    public function read($length)\n    {\n        $result = $this->stream->read($length);\n\n        // Invoke the callback when EOF is hit.\n        if ($this->eof()) {\n            ($this->callback)();\n        }\n\n        return $result;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis decorator could be added to any existing stream and used like so:\n\n```php\nuse GuzzleHttp\\Psr7;\n\n$original = Psr7\\Utils::streamFor('foo');\n\n$eofStream = new EofCallbackStream($original, function () {\n    echo 'EOF!';\n});\n\n$eofStream->read(2);\n$eofStream->read(1);\n// echoes \"EOF!\"\n$eofStream->seek(0);\n$eofStream->read(3);\n// echoes \"EOF!\"\n```\n\n\n## PHP StreamWrapper\n\nYou can use the `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\StreamWrapper` class if you need to use a\nPSR-7 stream as a PHP stream resource.\n\nUse the `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\StreamWrapper::getResource()` method to create a PHP\nstream from a PSR-7 stream.\n\n```php\nuse GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\StreamWrapper;\n\n$stream = GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Utils::streamFor('hello!');\n$resource = StreamWrapper::getResource($stream);\necho fread($resource, 6); // outputs hello!\n```\n\n\n# Static API\n\nThere are various static methods available under the `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7` namespace.\n\n\n## `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Message::toString`\n\n`public static function toString(MessageInterface $message): string`\n\nReturns the string representation of an HTTP message.\n\n```php\n$request = new GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Request('GET', 'http://example.com');\necho GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Message::toString($request);\n```\n\n\n## `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Message::bodySummary`\n\n`public static function bodySummary(MessageInterface $message, int $truncateAt = 120): string|null`\n\nGet a short summary of the message body.\n\nWill return `null` if the response is not printable.\n\n\n## `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Message::rewindBody`\n\n`public static function rewindBody(MessageInterface $message): void`\n\nAttempts to rewind a message body and throws an exception on failure.\n\nThe body of the message will only be rewound if a call to `tell()`\nreturns a value other than `0`.\n\n\n## `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Message::parseMessage`\n\n`public static function parseMessage(string $message): array`\n\nParses an HTTP message into an associative array.\n\nThe array contains the \"start-line\" key containing the start line of\nthe message, \"headers\" key containing an associative array of header\narray values, and a \"body\" key containing the body of the message.\n\n\n## `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Message::parseRequestUri`\n\n`public static function parseRequestUri(string $path, array $headers): string`\n\nConstructs a URI for an HTTP request message.\n\n\n## `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Message::parseRequest`\n\n`public static function parseRequest(string $message): Request`\n\nParses a request message string into a request object.\n\n\n## `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Message::parseResponse`\n\n`public static function parseResponse(string $message): Response`\n\nParses a response message string into a response object.\n\n\n## `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Header::parse`\n\n`public static function parse(string|array $header): array`\n\nParse an array of header values containing \";\" separated data into an\narray of associative arrays representing the header key value pair data\nof the header. When a parameter does not contain a value, but just\ncontains a key, this function will inject a key with a '' string value.\n\n\n## `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Header::splitList`\n\n`public static function splitList(string|string[] $header): string[]`\n\nSplits a HTTP header defined to contain a comma-separated list into\neach individual value:\n\n```\n$knownEtags = Header::splitList($request->getHeader('if-none-match'));\n```\n\nExample headers include `accept`, `cache-control` and `if-none-match`.\n\n\n## `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Header::normalize` (deprecated)\n\n`public static function normalize(string|array $header): array`\n\n`Header::normalize()` is deprecated in favor of [`Header::splitList()`](README.md#guzzlehttppsr7headersplitlist)\nwhich performs the same operation with a cleaned up API and improved\ndocumentation.\n\nConverts an array of header values that may contain comma separated\nheaders into an array of headers with no comma separated values.\n\n\n## `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Query::parse`\n\n`public static function parse(string $str, int|bool $urlEncoding = true): array`\n\nParse a query string into an associative array.\n\nIf multiple values are found for the same key, the value of that key\nvalue pair will become an array. This function does not parse nested\nPHP style arrays into an associative array (e.g., `foo[a]=1&foo[b]=2`\nwill be parsed into `['foo[a]' => '1', 'foo[b]' => '2'])`.\n\n\n## `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Query::build`\n\n`public static function build(array $params, int|false $encoding = PHP_QUERY_RFC3986, bool $treatBoolsAsInts = true): string`\n\nBuild a query string from an array of key value pairs.\n\nThis function can use the return value of `parse()` to build a query\nstring. This function does not modify the provided keys when an array is\nencountered (like `http_build_query()` would).\n\n\n## `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Utils::caselessRemove`\n\n`public static function caselessRemove(iterable<string> $keys, $keys, array $data): array`\n\nRemove the items given by the keys, case insensitively from the data.\n\n\n## `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Utils::copyToStream`\n\n`public static function copyToStream(StreamInterface $source, StreamInterface $dest, int $maxLen = -1): void`\n\nCopy the contents of a stream into another stream until the given number\nof bytes have been read.\n\n\n## `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Utils::copyToString`\n\n`public static function copyToString(StreamInterface $stream, int $maxLen = -1): string`\n\nCopy the contents of a stream into a string until the given number of\nbytes have been read.\n\n\n## `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Utils::hash`\n\n`public static function hash(StreamInterface $stream, string $algo, bool $rawOutput = false): string`\n\nCalculate a hash of a stream.\n\nThis method reads the entire stream to calculate a rolling hash, based on\nPHP's `hash_init` functions.\n\n\n## `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Utils::modifyRequest`\n\n`public static function modifyRequest(RequestInterface $request, array $changes): RequestInterface`\n\nClone and modify a request with the given changes.\n\nThis method is useful for reducing the number of clones needed to mutate\na message.\n\n- method: (string) Changes the HTTP method.\n- set_headers: (array) Sets the given headers.\n- remove_headers: (array) Remove the given headers.\n- body: (mixed) Sets the given body.\n- uri: (UriInterface) Set the URI.\n- query: (string) Set the query string value of the URI.\n- version: (string) Set the protocol version.\n\n\n## `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Utils::readLine`\n\n`public static function readLine(StreamInterface $stream, ?int $maxLength = null): string`\n\nRead a line from the stream up to the maximum allowed buffer length.\n\n\n## `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Utils::redactUserInfo`\n\n`public static function redactUserInfo(UriInterface $uri): UriInterface`\n\nRedact the password in the user info part of a URI.\n\n\n## `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Utils::streamFor`\n\n`public static function streamFor(resource|string|null|int|float|bool|StreamInterface|callable|\\Iterator $resource = '', array $options = []): StreamInterface`\n\nCreate a new stream based on the input type.\n\nOptions is an associative array that can contain the following keys:\n\n- metadata: Array of custom metadata.\n- size: Size of the stream.\n\nThis method accepts the following `$resource` types:\n\n- `Psr\\Http\\Message\\StreamInterface`: Returns the value as-is.\n- `string`: Creates a stream object that uses the given string as the contents.\n- `resource`: Creates a stream object that wraps the given PHP stream resource.\n- `Iterator`: If the provided value implements `Iterator`, then a read-only\n  stream object will be created that wraps the given iterable. Each time the\n  stream is read from, data from the iterator will fill a buffer and will be\n  continuously called until the buffer is equal to the requested read size.\n  Subsequent read calls will first read from the buffer and then call `next`\n  on the underlying iterator until it is exhausted.\n- `object` with `__toString()`: If the object has the `__toString()` method,\n  the object will be cast to a string and then a stream will be returned that\n  uses the string value.\n- `NULL`: When `null` is passed, an empty stream object is returned.\n- `callable` When a callable is passed, a read-only stream object will be\n  created that invokes the given callable. The callable is invoked with the\n  number of suggested bytes to read. The callable can return any number of\n  bytes, but MUST return `false` when there is no more data to return. The\n  stream object that wraps the callable will invoke the callable until the\n  number of requested bytes are available. Any additional bytes will be\n  buffered and used in subsequent reads.\n\n```php\n$stream = GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Utils::streamFor('foo');\n$stream = GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Utils::streamFor(fopen('/path/to/file', 'r'));\n\n$generator = function ($bytes) {\n    for ($i = 0; $i < $bytes; $i++) {\n        yield ' ';\n    }\n}\n\n$stream = GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Utils::streamFor($generator(100));\n```\n\n\n## `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Utils::tryFopen`\n\n`public static function tryFopen(string $filename, string $mode): resource`\n\nSafely opens a PHP stream resource using a filename.\n\nWhen fopen fails, PHP normally raises a warning.

The function API was removed in 2.0.0. A migration table has been provided here for your convenience:\n\n| Original Function | Replacement Method |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| `str` | `Message::toString` |\n| `uri_for` | `Utils::uriFor` |\n| `stream_for` | `Utils::streamFor` |\n| `parse_header` | `Header::parse` |\n| `normalize_header` | `Header::normalize` |\n| `modify_request` | `Utils::modifyRequest` |\n| `rewind_body` | `Message::rewindBody` |\n| `try_fopen` | `Utils::tryFopen` |\n| `copy_to_string` | `Utils::copyToString` |\n| `copy_to_stream` | `Utils::copyToStream` |\n| `hash` | `Utils::hash` |\n| `readline` | `Utils::readLine` |\n| `parse_request` | `Message::parseRequest` |\n| `parse_response` | `Message::parseResponse` |\n| `parse_query` | `Query::parse` |\n| `build_query` | `Query::build` |\n| `mimetype_from_filename` | `MimeType::fromFilename` |\n| `mimetype_from_extension` | `MimeType::fromExtension` |\n| `_parse_message` | `Message::parseMessage` |\n| `_parse_request_uri` | `Message::parseRequestUri` |\n| `get_message_body_summary` | `Message::bodySummary` |\n| `_caseless_remove` | `Utils::caselessRemove` |\n\n\n# Additional URI Methods\n\nAside from the standard `Psr\\Http\\Message\\UriInterface` implementation in form of the `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Uri` class,\nthis library also provides additional functionality when working with URIs as static methods.\n\n## URI Types\n\nAn instance of `Psr\\Http\\Message\\UriInterface` can either be an absolute URI or a relative reference.\nAn absolute URI has a scheme. A relative reference is used to express a URI relative to another URI,\nthe base URI. Relative references can be divided into several forms according to\n[RFC 3986 Section 4.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-4.2):\n\n- network-path references, e.g. `//example.com/path`\n- absolute-path references, e.g. `/path`\n- relative-path references, e.g. `subpath`\n\nThe following methods can be used to identify the type of the URI.\n\n### `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Uri::isAbsolute`\n\n`public static function isAbsolute(UriInterface $uri): bool`\n\nWhether the URI is absolute, i.e. it has a scheme.\n\n### `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Uri::isNetworkPathReference`\n\n`public static function isNetworkPathReference(UriInterface $uri): bool`\n\nWhether the URI is a network-path reference. A relative reference that begins with two slash characters is\ntermed an network-path reference.\n\n### `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Uri::isAbsolutePathReference`\n\n`public static function isAbsolutePathReference(UriInterface $uri): bool`\n\nWhether the URI is a absolute-path reference. A relative reference that begins with a single slash character is\ntermed an absolute-path reference.\n\n### `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Uri::isRelativePathReference`\n\n`public static function isRelativePathReference(UriInterface $uri): bool`\n\nWhether the URI is a relative-path reference. A relative reference that does not begin with a slash character is\ntermed a relative-path reference.\n\n### `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Uri::isSameDocumentReference`\n\n`public static function isSameDocumentReference(UriInterface $uri, ?UriInterface $base = null): bool`\n\nWhether the URI is a same-document reference. A same-document reference refers to a URI that is, aside from its\nfragment component, identical to the base URI. When no base URI is given, only an empty URI reference\n(apart from its fragment) is considered a same-document reference.\n\n## URI Components\n\nAdditional methods to work with URI components.\n\n### `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Uri::isDefaultPort`\n\n`public static function isDefaultPort(UriInterface $uri): bool`\n\nWhether the URI has the default port of the current scheme. `Psr\\Http\\Message\\UriInterface::getPort` may return null\nor the standard port. This method can be used independently of the implementation.\n\n### `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Uri::composeComponents`\n\n`public static function composeComponents($scheme, $authority, $path, $query, $fragment): string`\n\nComposes a URI reference string from its various components according to\n[RFC 3986 Section 5.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-5.3). Usually this method does not need\nto be called manually but instead is used indirectly via `Psr\\Http\\Message\\UriInterface::__toString`.\n\n### `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Uri::fromParts`\n\n`public static function fromParts(array $parts): UriInterface`\n\nCreates a URI from a hash of [`parse_url`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.parse-url.php) components.\n\n\n### `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Uri::withQueryValue`\n\n`public static function withQueryValue(UriInterface $uri, $key, $value): UriInterface`\n\nCreates a new URI with a specific query string value. Any existing query string values that exactly match the\nprovided key are removed and replaced with the given key value pair. A value of null will set the query string\nkey without a value, e.g. \"key\" instead of \"key=value\".\n\n### `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Uri::withQueryValues`\n\n`public static function withQueryValues(UriInterface $uri, array $keyValueArray): UriInterface`\n\nCreates a new URI with multiple query string values. It has the same behavior as `withQueryValue()` but for an\nassociative array of key => value.\n\n### `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Uri::withoutQueryValue`\n\n`public static function withoutQueryValue(UriInterface $uri, $key): UriInterface`\n\nCreates a new URI with a specific query string value removed. Any existing query string values that exactly match the\nprovided key are removed.\n\n## Cross-Origin Detection\n\n`GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\UriComparator` provides methods to determine if a modified URL should be considered cross-origin.\n\n### `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\UriComparator::isCrossOrigin`\n\n`public static function isCrossOrigin(UriInterface $original, UriInterface $modified): bool`\n\nDetermines if a modified URL should be considered cross-origin with respect to an original URL.\n\n## Reference Resolution\n\n`GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\UriResolver` provides methods to resolve a URI reference in the context of a base URI according\nto [RFC 3986 Section 5](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-5). This is for example also what web\nbrowsers do when resolving a link in a website based on the current request URI.\n\n### `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\UriResolver::resolve`\n\n`public static function resolve(UriInterface $base, UriInterface $rel): UriInterface`\n\nConverts the relative URI into a new URI that is resolved against the base URI.\n\n### `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\UriResolver::removeDotSegments`\n\n`public static function removeDotSegments(string $path): string`\n\nRemoves dot segments from a path and returns the new path according to\n[RFC 3986 Section 5.2.4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-5.2.4).\n\n### `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\UriResolver::relativize`\n\n`public static function relativize(UriInterface $base, UriInterface $target): UriInterface`\n\nReturns the target URI as a relative reference from the base URI. This method is the counterpart to resolve():\n\n```php\n(string) $target === (string) UriResolver::resolve($base, UriResolver::relativize($base, $target))\n```\n\nOne use-case is to use the current request URI as base URI and then generate relative links in your documents\nto reduce the document size or offer self-contained downloadable document archives.\n\n```php\n$base = new Uri('http://example.com/a/b/');\necho UriResolver::relativize($base, new Uri('http://example.com/a/b/c'));  // prints 'c'.\necho UriResolver::relativize($base, new Uri('http://example.com/a/x/y'));  // prints '../x/y'.\necho UriResolver::relativize($base, new Uri('http://example.com/a/b/?q')); // prints '?q'.\necho UriResolver::relativize($base, new Uri('http://example.org/a/b/'));   // prints '//example.org/a/b/'.\n```\n\n## Normalization and Comparison\n\n`GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\UriNormalizer` provides methods to normalize and compare URIs according to\n[RFC 3986 Section 6](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-6).\n\n### `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\UriNormalizer::normalize`\n\n`public static function normalize(UriInterface $uri, $flags = self::PRESERVING_NORMALIZATIONS): UriInterface`\n\nReturns a normalized URI. The scheme and host component are already normalized to lowercase per PSR-7 UriInterface.\nThis methods adds additional normalizations that can be configured with the `$flags` parameter which is a bitmask\nof normalizations to apply. The following normalizations are available:\n\n- `UriNormalizer::PRESERVING_NORMALIZATIONS`\n\n    Default normalizations which only include the ones that preserve semantics.\n\n- `UriNormalizer::CAPITALIZE_PERCENT_ENCODING`\n\n    All letters within a percent-encoding triplet (e.g., \"%3A\") are case-insensitive, and should be capitalized.\n\n    Example: `http://example.org/a%c2%b1b` → `http://example.org/a%C2%B1b`\n\n- `UriNormalizer::DECODE_UNRESERVED_CHARACTERS`\n\n    Decodes percent-encoded octets of unreserved characters. For consistency, percent-encoded octets in the ranges of\n    ALPHA (%41–%5A and %61–%7A), DIGIT (%30–%39), hyphen (%2D), period (%2E), underscore (%5F), or tilde (%7E) should\n    not be created by URI producers and, when found in a URI, should be decoded to their corresponding unreserved\n    characters by URI normalizers.\n\n    Example: `http://example.org/%7Eusern%61me/` → `http://example.org/~username/`\n\n- `UriNormalizer::CONVERT_EMPTY_PATH`\n\n    Converts the empty path to \"/\" for http and https URIs.\n\n    Example: `http://example.org` → `http://example.org/`\n\n- `UriNormalizer::REMOVE_DEFAULT_HOST`\n\n    Removes the default host of the given URI scheme from the URI. Only the \"file\" scheme defines the default host\n    \"localhost\". All of `file:/myfile`, `file:///myfile`, and `file://localhost/myfile` are equivalent according to\n    RFC 3986.\n\n    Example: `file://localhost/myfile` → `file:///myfile`\n\n- `UriNormalizer::REMOVE_DEFAULT_PORT`\n\n    Removes the default port of the given URI scheme from the URI.\n\n    Example: `http://example.org:80/` → `http://example.org/`\n\n- `UriNormalizer::REMOVE_DOT_SEGMENTS`\n\n    Removes unnecessary dot-segments. Dot-segments in relative-path references are not removed as it would\n    change the semantics of the URI reference.\n\n    Example: `http://example.org/../a/b/../c/./d.html` → `http://example.org/a/c/d.html`\n\n- `UriNormalizer::REMOVE_DUPLICATE_SLASHES`\n\n    Paths which include two or more adjacent slashes are converted to one. Webservers usually ignore duplicate slashes\n    and treat those URIs equivalent. But in theory those URIs do not need to be equivalent. So this normalization\n    may change the semantics. Encoded slashes (%2F) are not removed.\n\n    Example: `http://example.org//foo///bar.html` → `http://example.org/foo/bar.html`\n\n- `UriNormalizer::SORT_QUERY_PARAMETERS`\n\n    Sort query parameters with their values in alphabetical order. However, the order of parameters in a URI may be\n    significant (this is not defined by the standard). So this normalization is not safe and may change the semantics\n    of the URI.\n\n    Example: `?lang=en&article=fred` → `?article=fred&lang=en`\n\n### `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\UriNormalizer::isEquivalent`\n\n`public static function isEquivalent(UriInterface $uri1, UriInterface $uri2, $normalizations = self::PRESERVING_NORMALIZATIONS): bool`\n\nWhether two URIs can be considered equivalent. Both URIs are normalized automatically before comparison with the given\n`$normalizations` bitmask. The method also accepts relative URI references and returns true when they are equivalent.\nThis of course assumes they will be resolved against the same base URI. If this is not the case, determination of\nequivalence or difference of relative references does not mean anything.\n\n\n## Security\n\nIf you discover a security vulnerability within this package, please send an email to security@tidelift.com.

The minimum supported PHP version is now PHP 7.2. Type hints and return\ntypes for functions and methods have been added wherever possible. \n\nPlease make sure:\n- You are calling a function or a method with the correct type.\n- If you extend a class of Guzzle; update all signatures on methods you override.\n\n#### Other backwards compatibility breaking changes\n\n- Class `GuzzleHttp\\UriTemplate` is removed.\n- Class `GuzzleHttp\\Exception\\SeekException` is removed.\n- Classes `GuzzleHttp\\Exception\\BadResponseException`, `GuzzleHttp\\Exception\\ClientException`, \n  `GuzzleHttp\\Exception\\ServerException` can no longer be initialized with an empty\n  Response as argument.\n- Class `GuzzleHttp\\Exception\\ConnectException` now extends `GuzzleHttp\\Exception\\TransferException`\n  instead of `GuzzleHttp\\Exception\\RequestException`.\n- Function `GuzzleHttp\\Exception\\ConnectException::getResponse()` is removed.\n- Function `GuzzleHttp\\Exception\\ConnectException::hasResponse()` is removed.\n- Constant `GuzzleHttp\\ClientInterface::VERSION` is removed. Added `GuzzleHttp\\ClientInterface::MAJOR_VERSION` instead.\n- Function `GuzzleHttp\\Exception\\RequestException::getResponseBodySummary` is removed.\n  Use `\\GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\get_message_body_summary` as an alternative.\n- Function `GuzzleHttp\\Cookie\\CookieJar::getCookieValue` is removed.\n- Request option `exceptions` is removed. Please use `http_errors`.\n- Request option `save_to` is removed. Please use `sink`.\n- Pool option `pool_size` is removed. Please use `concurrency`.\n- We now look for environment variables in the `$_SERVER` super global, due to thread safety issues with `getenv`. We continue to fallback to `getenv` in CLI environments, for maximum compatibility.\n- The `get`, `head`, `put`, `post`, `patch`, `delete`, `getAsync`, `headAsync`, `putAsync`, `postAsync`, `patchAsync`, and `deleteAsync` methods are now implemented as genuine methods on `GuzzleHttp\\Client`, with strong typing. The original `__call` implementation remains unchanged for now, for maximum backwards compatibility, but won't be invoked under normal operation.\n- The `log` middleware will log the errors with level `error` instead of `notice` \n- Support for international domain names (IDN) is now disabled by default, and enabling it requires installing ext-intl, linked against a modern version of the C library (ICU 4.6 or higher).\n\n#### Native functions calls\n\nAll internal native functions calls of Guzzle are now prefixed with a slash. This\nchange makes it impossible for method overloading by other libraries or applications.\nExample:\n\n```php\n// Before:\ncurl_version();\n\n// After:\n\\curl_version();\n```\n\nFor the full diff you can check [here](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/compare/6.5.4..master).\n\n5.0 to 6.0\n----------\n\nGuzzle now uses [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) for HTTP messages.\nDue to the fact that these messages are immutable, this prompted a refactoring\nof Guzzle to use a middleware based system rather than an event system. Any\nHTTP message interaction (e.g., `GuzzleHttp\\Message\\Request`) need to be\nupdated to work with the new immutable PSR-7 request and response objects. Any\nevent listeners or subscribers need to be updated to become middleware\nfunctions that wrap handlers (or are injected into a\n`GuzzleHttp\\HandlerStack`).\n\n- Removed `GuzzleHttp\\BatchResults`\n- Removed `GuzzleHttp\\Collection`\n- Removed `GuzzleHttp\\HasDataTrait`\n- Removed `GuzzleHttp\\ToArrayInterface`\n- The `guzzlehttp/streams` dependency has been removed. Stream functionality\n  is now present in the `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7` namespace provided by the\n  `guzzlehttp/psr7` package.\n- Guzzle no longer uses ReactPHP promises and now uses the\n  `guzzlehttp/promises` library. We use a custom promise library for three\n  significant reasons:\n  1. React promises (at the time of writing this) are recursive. Promise\n     chaining and promise resolution will eventually blow the stack. Guzzle\n     promises are not recursive as they use a sort of trampolining technique.\n     Note: there has been movement in the React project to modify promises to\n     no longer utilize recursion.\n  2. Guzzle needs to have the ability to synchronously block on a promise to\n     wait for a result. Guzzle promises allows this functionality (and does\n     not require the use of recursion).\n  3. Because we need to be able to wait on a result, doing so using React\n     promises requires wrapping react promises with RingPHP futures. This\n     overhead is no longer needed, reducing stack sizes, reducing complexity,\n     and improving performance.\n- `GuzzleHttp\\Mimetypes` has been moved to a function in\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\mimetype_from_extension` and\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\mimetype_from_filename`.\n- `GuzzleHttp\\Query` and `GuzzleHttp\\QueryParser` have been removed. Query\n  strings must now be passed into request objects as strings, or provided to\n  the `query` request option when creating requests with clients. The `query`\n  option uses PHP's `http_build_query` to convert an array to a string. If you\n  need a different serialization technique, you will need to pass the query\n  string in as a string. There are a couple helper functions that will make\n  working with query strings easier: `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\parse_query` and\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\build_query`.\n- Guzzle no longer has a dependency on RingPHP. Due to the use of a middleware\n  system based on PSR-7, using RingPHP and it's middleware system as well adds\n  more complexity than the benefits it provides. All HTTP handlers that were\n  present in RingPHP have been modified to work directly with PSR-7 messages\n  and placed in the `GuzzleHttp\\Handler` namespace. This significantly reduces\n  complexity in Guzzle, removes a dependency, and improves performance. RingPHP\n  will be maintained for Guzzle 5 support, but will no longer be a part of\n  Guzzle 6.\n- As Guzzle now uses a middleware based systems the event system and RingPHP\n  integration has been removed. Note: while the event system has been removed,\n  it is possible to add your own type of event system that is powered by the\n  middleware system.\n  - Removed the `Event` namespace.\n  - Removed the `Subscriber` namespace.\n  - Removed `Transaction` class\n  - Removed `RequestFsm`\n  - Removed `RingBridge`\n  - `GuzzleHttp\\Subscriber\\Cookie` is now provided by\n    `GuzzleHttp\\Middleware::cookies`\n  - `GuzzleHttp\\Subscriber\\HttpError` is now provided by\n    `GuzzleHttp\\Middleware::httpError`\n  - `GuzzleHttp\\Subscriber\\History` is now provided by\n    `GuzzleHttp\\Middleware::history`\n  - `GuzzleHttp\\Subscriber\\Mock` is now provided by\n    `GuzzleHttp\\Handler\\MockHandler`\n  - `GuzzleHttp\\Subscriber\\Prepare` is now provided by\n    `GuzzleHttp\\PrepareBodyMiddleware`\n  - `GuzzleHttp\\Subscriber\\Redirect` is now provided by\n    `GuzzleHttp\\RedirectMiddleware`\n- Guzzle now uses `Psr\\Http\\Message\\UriInterface` (implements in\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Uri`) for URI support. `GuzzleHttp\\Url` is now gone.\n- Static functions in `GuzzleHttp\\Utils` have been moved to namespaced\n  functions under the `GuzzleHttp` namespace. This requires either a Composer\n  based autoloader or you to include functions.php.\n- `GuzzleHttp\\ClientInterface::getDefaultOption` has been renamed to\n  `GuzzleHttp\\ClientInterface::getConfig`.\n- `GuzzleHttp\\ClientInterface::setDefaultOption` has been removed.\n- The `json` and `xml` methods of response objects has been removed. With the\n  migration to strictly adhering to PSR-7 as the interface for Guzzle messages,\n  adding methods to message interfaces would actually require Guzzle messages\n  to extend from PSR-7 messages rather then work with them directly.\n\n## Migrating to middleware\n\nThe change to PSR-7 unfortunately required significant refactoring to Guzzle\ndue to the fact that PSR-7 messages are immutable. Guzzle 5 relied on an event\nsystem from plugins. The event system relied on mutability of HTTP messages and\nside effects in order to work. With immutable messages, you have to change your\nworkflow to become more about either returning a value (e.g., functional\nmiddlewares) or setting a value on an object. Guzzle v6 has chosen the\nfunctional middleware approach.\n\nInstead of using the event system to listen for things like the `before` event,\nyou now create a stack based middleware function that intercepts a request on\nthe way in and the promise of the response on the way out. This is a much\nsimpler and more predictable approach than the event system and works nicely\nwith PSR-7 middleware. Due to the use of promises, the middleware system is\nalso asynchronous.\n\nv5:\n\n```php\nuse GuzzleHttp\\Event\\BeforeEvent;\n$client = new GuzzleHttp\\Client();\n// Get the emitter and listen to the before event.\n$client->getEmitter()->on('before', function (BeforeEvent $e) {\n    // Guzzle v5 events relied on mutation\n    $e->getRequest()->setHeader('X-Foo', 'Bar');\n});\n```\n\nv6:\n\nIn v6, you can modify the request before it is sent using the `mapRequest`\nmiddleware. The idiomatic way in v6 to modify the request/response lifecycle is\nto setup a handler middleware stack up front and inject the handler into a\nclient.\n\n```php\nuse GuzzleHttp\\Middleware;\n// Create a handler stack that has all of the default middlewares attached\n$handler = GuzzleHttp\\HandlerStack::create();\n// Push the handler onto the handler stack\n$handler->push(Middleware::mapRequest(function (RequestInterface $request) {\n    // Notice that we have to return a request object\n    return $request->withHeader('X-Foo', 'Bar');\n}));\n// Inject the handler into the client\n$client = new GuzzleHttp\\Client(['handler' => $handler]);\n```\n\n## POST Requests\n\nThis version added the [`form_params`](https://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/latest/request-options.html#form_params)\nand `multipart` request options. `form_params` is an associative array of\nstrings or array of strings and is used to serialize an\n`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` POST request. The\n[`multipart`](https://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/latest/request-options.html#multipart)\noption is now used to send a multipart/form-data POST request.\n\n`GuzzleHttp\\Post\\PostFile` has been removed. Use the `multipart` option to add\nPOST files to a multipart/form-data request.\n\nThe `body` option no longer accepts an array to send POST requests. Please use\n`multipart` or `form_params` instead.\n\nThe `base_url` option has been renamed to `base_uri`.\n\n4.x to 5.0\n----------\n\n## Rewritten Adapter Layer\n\nGuzzle now uses [RingPHP](https://ringphp.readthedocs.org/en/latest) to send\nHTTP requests. The `adapter` option in a `GuzzleHttp\\Client` constructor\nis still supported, but it has now been renamed to `handler`. Instead of\npassing a `GuzzleHttp\\Adapter\\AdapterInterface`, you must now pass a PHP\n`callable` that follows the RingPHP specification.\n\n## Removed Fluent Interfaces\n\n[Fluent interfaces were removed](https://ocramius.github.io/blog/fluent-interfaces-are-evil/)\nfrom the following classes:\n\n- `GuzzleHttp\\Collection`\n- `GuzzleHttp\\Url`\n- `GuzzleHttp\\Query`\n- `GuzzleHttp\\Post\\PostBody`\n- `GuzzleHttp\\Cookie\\SetCookie`\n\n## Removed functions.php\n\nRemoved \"functions.php\", so that Guzzle is truly PSR-4 compliant. The following\nfunctions can be used as replacements.\n\n- `GuzzleHttp\\json_decode` -> `GuzzleHttp\\Utils::jsonDecode`\n- `GuzzleHttp\\get_path` -> `GuzzleHttp\\Utils::getPath`\n- `GuzzleHttp\\Utils::setPath` -> `GuzzleHttp\\set_path`\n- `GuzzleHttp\\Pool::batch` -> `GuzzleHttp\\batch`. This function is, however,\n  deprecated in favor of using `GuzzleHttp\\Pool::batch()`.\n\nThe \"procedural\" global client has been removed with no replacement (e.g.,\n`GuzzleHttp\\get()`, `GuzzleHttp\\post()`, etc.). Use a `GuzzleHttp\\Client`\nobject as a replacement.\n\n## `throwImmediately` has been removed\n\nThe concept of \"throwImmediately\" has been removed from exceptions and error\nevents. This control mechanism was used to stop a transfer of concurrent\nrequests from completing. This can now be handled by throwing the exception or\nby cancelling a pool of requests or each outstanding future request\nindividually.\n\n## headers event has been removed\n\nRemoved the \"headers\" event. This event was only useful for changing the\nbody a response once the headers of the response were known. You can implement\na similar behavior in a number of ways. One example might be to use a\nFnStream that has access to the transaction being sent. For example, when the\nfirst byte is written, you could check if the response headers match your\nexpectations, and if so, change the actual stream body that is being\nwritten to.\n\n## Updates to HTTP Messages\n\nRemoved the `asArray` parameter from\n`GuzzleHttp\\Message\\MessageInterface::getHeader`. If you want to get a header\nvalue as an array, then use the newly added `getHeaderAsArray()` method of\n`MessageInterface`. This change makes the Guzzle interfaces compatible with\nthe PSR-7 interfaces.\n\n3.x to 4.0\n----------\n\n## Overarching changes:\n\n- Now requires PHP 5.4 or greater.\n- No longer requires cURL to send requests.\n- Guzzle no longer wraps every exception it throws. Only exceptions that are\n  recoverable are now wrapped by Guzzle.\n- Various namespaces have been removed or renamed.\n- No longer requiring the Symfony EventDispatcher. A custom event dispatcher\n  based on the Symfony EventDispatcher is\n  now utilized in `GuzzleHttp\\Event\\EmitterInterface` (resulting in significant\n  speed and functionality improvements).\n\nChanges per Guzzle 3.x namespace are described below.\n\n## Batch\n\nThe `Guzzle\\Batch` namespace has been removed. This is best left to\nthird-parties to implement on top of Guzzle's core HTTP library.\n\n## Cache\n\nThe `Guzzle\\Cache` namespace has been removed. (Todo: No suitable replacement\nhas been implemented yet, but hoping to utilize a PSR cache interface).\n\n## Common\n\n- Removed all of the wrapped exceptions. It's better to use the standard PHP\n  library for unrecoverable exceptions.\n- `FromConfigInterface` has been removed.\n- `Guzzle\\Common\\Version` has been removed. The VERSION constant can be found\n  at `GuzzleHttp\\ClientInterface::VERSION`.\n\n### Collection\n\n- `getAll` has been removed. Use `toArray` to convert a collection to an array.\n- `inject` has been removed.\n- `keySearch` has been removed.\n- `getPath` no longer supports wildcard expressions. Use something better like\n  JMESPath for this.\n- `setPath` now supports appending to an existing array via the `[]` notation.\n\n### Events\n\nGuzzle no longer requires Symfony's EventDispatcher component. Guzzle now uses\n`GuzzleHttp\\Event\\Emitter`.\n\n- `Symfony\\Component\\EventDispatcher\\EventDispatcherInterface` is replaced by\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Event\\EmitterInterface`.\n- `Symfony\\Component\\EventDispatcher\\EventDispatcher` is replaced by\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Event\\Emitter`.\n- `Symfony\\Component\\EventDispatcher\\Event` is replaced by\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Event\\Event`, and Guzzle now has an EventInterface in\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Event\\EventInterface`.\n- `AbstractHasDispatcher` has moved to a trait, `HasEmitterTrait`, and\n  `HasDispatcherInterface` has moved to `HasEmitterInterface`. Retrieving the\n  event emitter of a request, client, etc. now uses the `getEmitter` method\n  rather than the `getDispatcher` method.\n\n#### Emitter\n\n- Use the `once()` method to add a listener that automatically removes itself\n  the first time it is invoked.\n- Use the `listeners()` method to retrieve a list of event listeners rather than\n  the `getListeners()` method.\n- Use `emit()` instead of `dispatch()` to emit an event from an emitter.\n- Use `attach()` instead of `addSubscriber()` and `detach()` instead of\n  `removeSubscriber()`.\n\n```php\n$mock = new Mock();\n// 3.x\n$request->getEventDispatcher()->addSubscriber($mock);\n$request->getEventDispatcher()->removeSubscriber($mock);\n// 4.x\n$request->getEmitter()->attach($mock);\n$request->getEmitter()->detach($mock);\n```\n\nUse the `on()` method to add a listener rather than the `addListener()` method.\n\n```php\n// 3.x\n$request->getEventDispatcher()->addListener('foo', function (Event $event) { /* ... */ } );\n// 4.x\n$request->getEmitter()->on('foo', function (Event $event, $name) { /* ... */ } );\n```\n\n## Http\n\n### General changes\n\n- The cacert.pem certificate has been moved to `src/cacert.pem`.\n- Added the concept of adapters that are used to transfer requests over the\n  wire.\n- Simplified the event system.\n- Sending requests in parallel is still possible, but batching is no longer a\n  concept of the HTTP layer. Instead, you must use the `complete` and `error`\n  events to asynchronously manage parallel request transfers.\n- `Guzzle\\Http\\Url` has moved to `GuzzleHttp\\Url`.\n- `Guzzle\\Http\\QueryString` has moved to `GuzzleHttp\\Query`.\n- QueryAggregators have been rewritten so that they are simply callable\n  functions.\n- `GuzzleHttp\\StaticClient` has been removed. Use the functions provided in\n  `functions.php` for an easy to use static client instance.\n- Exceptions in `GuzzleHttp\\Exception` have been updated to all extend from\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Exception\\TransferException`.\n\n### Client\n\nCalling methods like `get()`, `post()`, `head()`, etc. no longer create and\nreturn a request, but rather creates a request, sends the request, and returns\nthe response.\n\n```php\n// 3.0\n$request = $client->get('/');\n$response = $request->send();\n\n// 4.0\n$response = $client->get('/');\n\n// or, to mirror the previous behavior\n$request = $client->createRequest('GET', '/');\n$response = $client->send($request);\n```\n\n`GuzzleHttp\\ClientInterface` has changed.\n\n- The `send` method no longer accepts more than one request. Use `sendAll` to\n  send multiple requests in parallel.\n- `setUserAgent()` has been removed. Use a default request option instead. You\n  could, for example, do something like:\n  `$client->setConfig('defaults/headers/User-Agent', 'Foo/Bar ' . $client::getDefaultUserAgent())`.\n- `setSslVerification()` has been removed. Use default request options instead,\n  like `$client->setConfig('defaults/verify', true)`.\n\n`GuzzleHttp\\Client` has changed.\n\n- The constructor now accepts only an associative array. You can include a\n  `base_url` string or array to use a URI template as the base URL of a client.\n  You can also specify a `defaults` key that is an associative array of default\n  request options. You can pass an `adapter` to use a custom adapter,\n  `batch_adapter` to use a custom adapter for sending requests in parallel, or\n  a `message_factory` to change the factory used to create HTTP requests and\n  responses.\n- The client no longer emits a `client.create_request` event.\n- Creating requests with a client no longer automatically utilize a URI\n  template. You must pass an array into a creational method (e.g.,\n  `createRequest`, `get`, `put`, etc.) in order to expand a URI template.\n\n### Messages\n\nMessages no longer have references to their counterparts (i.e., a request no\nlonger has a reference to it's response, and a response no loger has a\nreference to its request). This association is now managed through a\n`GuzzleHttp\\Adapter\\TransactionInterface` object. You can get references to\nthese transaction objects using request events that are emitted over the\nlifecycle of a request.\n\n#### Requests with a body\n\n- `GuzzleHttp\\Message\\EntityEnclosingRequest` and\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Message\\EntityEnclosingRequestInterface` have been removed. The\n  separation between requests that contain a body and requests that do not\n  contain a body has been removed, and now `GuzzleHttp\\Message\\RequestInterface`\n  handles both use cases.\n- Any method that previously accepts a `GuzzleHttp\\Response` object now accept a\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Message\\ResponseInterface`.\n- `GuzzleHttp\\Message\\RequestFactoryInterface` has been renamed to\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Message\\MessageFactoryInterface`. This interface is used to create\n  both requests and responses and is implemented in\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Message\\MessageFactory`.\n- POST field and file methods have been removed from the request object. You\n  must now use the methods made available to `GuzzleHttp\\Post\\PostBodyInterface`\n  to control the format of a POST body. Requests that are created using a\n  standard `GuzzleHttp\\Message\\MessageFactoryInterface` will automatically use\n  a `GuzzleHttp\\Post\\PostBody` body if the body was passed as an array or if\n  the method is POST and no body is provided.\n\n```php\n$request = $client->createRequest('POST', '/');\n$request->getBody()->setField('foo', 'bar');\n$request->getBody()->addFile(new PostFile('file_key', fopen('/path/to/content', 'r')));\n```\n\n#### Headers\n\n- `GuzzleHttp\\Message\\Header` has been removed. Header values are now simply\n  represented by an array of values or as a string. Header values are returned\n  as a string by default when retrieving a header value from a message. You can\n  pass an optional argument of `true` to retrieve a header value as an array\n  of strings instead of a single concatenated string.\n- `GuzzleHttp\\PostFile` and `GuzzleHttp\\PostFileInterface` have been moved to\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Post`. This interface has been simplified and now allows the\n  addition of arbitrary headers.\n- Custom headers like `GuzzleHttp\\Message\\Header\\Link` have been removed. Most\n  of the custom headers are now handled separately in specific\n  subscribers/plugins, and `GuzzleHttp\\Message\\HeaderValues::parseParams()` has\n  been updated to properly handle headers that contain parameters (like the\n  `Link` header).\n\n#### Responses\n\n- `GuzzleHttp\\Message\\Response::getInfo()` and\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Message\\Response::setInfo()` have been removed. Use the event\n  system to retrieve this type of information.\n- `GuzzleHttp\\Message\\Response::getRawHeaders()` has been removed.\n- `GuzzleHttp\\Message\\Response::getMessage()` has been removed.\n- `GuzzleHttp\\Message\\Response::calculateAge()` and other cache specific\n  methods have moved to the CacheSubscriber.\n- Header specific helper functions like `getContentMd5()` have been removed.\n  Just use `getHeader('Content-MD5')` instead.\n- `GuzzleHttp\\Message\\Response::setRequest()` and\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Message\\Response::getRequest()` have been removed. Use the event\n  system to work with request and response objects as a transaction.\n- `GuzzleHttp\\Message\\Response::getRedirectCount()` has been removed. Use the\n  Redirect subscriber instead.\n- `GuzzleHttp\\Message\\Response::isSuccessful()` and other related methods have\n  been removed. Use `getStatusCode()` instead.\n\n#### Streaming responses\n\nStreaming requests can now be created by a client directly, returning a\n`GuzzleHttp\\Message\\ResponseInterface` object that contains a body stream\nreferencing an open PHP HTTP stream.\n\n```php\n// 3.0\nuse Guzzle\\Stream\\PhpStreamRequestFactory;\n$request = $client->get('/');\n$factory = new PhpStreamRequestFactory();\n$stream = $factory->fromRequest($request);\n$data = $stream->read(1024);\n\n// 4.0\n$response = $client->get('/', ['stream' => true]);\n// Read some data off of the stream in the response body\n$data = $response->getBody()->read(1024);\n```\n\n#### Redirects\n\nThe `configureRedirects()` method has been removed in favor of a\n`allow_redirects` request option.\n\n```php\n// Standard redirects with a default of a max of 5 redirects\n$request = $client->createRequest('GET', '/', ['allow_redirects' => true]);\n\n// Strict redirects with a custom number of redirects\n$request = $client->createRequest('GET', '/', [\n    'allow_redirects' => ['max' => 5, 'strict' => true]\n]);\n```\n\n#### EntityBody\n\nEntityBody interfaces and classes have been removed or moved to\n`GuzzleHttp\\Stream`. All classes and interfaces that once required\n`GuzzleHttp\\EntityBodyInterface` now require\n`GuzzleHttp\\Stream\\StreamInterface`. Creating a new body for a request no\nlonger uses `GuzzleHttp\\EntityBody::factory` but now uses\n`GuzzleHttp\\Stream\\Stream::factory` or even better:\n`GuzzleHttp\\Stream\\create()`.\n\n- `Guzzle\\Http\\EntityBodyInterface` is now `GuzzleHttp\\Stream\\StreamInterface`\n- `Guzzle\\Http\\EntityBody` is now `GuzzleHttp\\Stream\\Stream`\n- `Guzzle\\Http\\CachingEntityBody` is now `GuzzleHttp\\Stream\\CachingStream`\n- `Guzzle\\Http\\ReadLimitEntityBody` is now `GuzzleHttp\\Stream\\LimitStream`\n- `Guzzle\\Http\\IoEmittyinEntityBody` has been removed.\n\n#### Request lifecycle events\n\nRequests previously submitted a large number of requests. The number of events\nemitted over the lifecycle of a request has been significantly reduced to make\nit easier to understand how to extend the behavior of a request. All events\nemitted during the lifecycle of a request now emit a custom\n`GuzzleHttp\\Event\\EventInterface` object that contains context providing\nmethods and a way in which to modify the transaction at that specific point in\ntime (e.g., intercept the request and set a response on the transaction).\n\n- `request.before_send` has been renamed to `before` and now emits a\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Event\\BeforeEvent`\n- `request.complete` has been renamed to `complete` and now emits a\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Event\\CompleteEvent`.\n- `request.sent` has been removed. Use `complete`.\n- `request.success` has been removed. Use `complete`.\n- `error` is now an event that emits a `GuzzleHttp\\Event\\ErrorEvent`.\n- `request.exception` has been removed. Use `error`.\n- `request.receive.status_line` has been removed.\n- `curl.callback.progress` has been removed. Use a custom `StreamInterface` to\n  maintain a status update.\n- `curl.callback.write` has been removed. Use a custom `StreamInterface` to\n  intercept writes.\n- `curl.callback.read` has been removed. Use a custom `StreamInterface` to\n  intercept reads.\n\n`headers` is a new event that is emitted after the response headers of a\nrequest have been received before the body of the response is downloaded. This\nevent emits a `GuzzleHttp\\Event\\HeadersEvent`.\n\nYou can intercept a request and inject a response using the `intercept()` event\nof a `GuzzleHttp\\Event\\BeforeEvent`, `GuzzleHttp\\Event\\CompleteEvent`, and\n`GuzzleHttp\\Event\\ErrorEvent` event.\n\nSee: https://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/latest/events.html\n\n## Inflection\n\nThe `Guzzle\\Inflection` namespace has been removed. This is not a core concern\nof Guzzle.\n\n## Iterator\n\nThe `Guzzle\\Iterator` namespace has been removed.\n\n- `Guzzle\\Iterator\\AppendIterator`, `Guzzle\\Iterator\\ChunkedIterator`, and\n  `Guzzle\\Iterator\\MethodProxyIterator` are nice, but not a core requirement of\n  Guzzle itself.\n- `Guzzle\\Iterator\\FilterIterator` is no longer needed because an equivalent\n  class is shipped with PHP 5.4.\n- `Guzzle\\Iterator\\MapIterator` is not really needed when using PHP 5.5 because\n  it's easier to just wrap an iterator in a generator that maps values.\n\nFor a replacement of these iterators, see https://github.com/nikic/iter\n\n## Log\n\nThe LogPlugin has moved to https://github.com/guzzle/log-subscriber. The\n`Guzzle\\Log` namespace has been removed. Guzzle now relies on\n`Psr\\Log\\LoggerInterface` for all logging. The MessageFormatter class has been\nmoved to `GuzzleHttp\\Subscriber\\Log\\Formatter`.\n\n## Parser\n\nThe `Guzzle\\Parser` namespace has been removed. This was previously used to\nmake it possible to plug in custom parsers for cookies, messages, URI\ntemplates, and URLs; however, this level of complexity is not needed in Guzzle\nso it has been removed.\n\n- Cookie: Cookie parsing logic has been moved to\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Cookie\\SetCookie::fromString`.\n- Message: Message parsing logic for both requests and responses has been moved\n  to `GuzzleHttp\\Message\\MessageFactory::fromMessage`. Message parsing is only\n  used in debugging or deserializing messages, so it doesn't make sense for\n  Guzzle as a library to add this level of complexity to parsing messages.\n- UriTemplate: URI template parsing has been moved to\n  `GuzzleHttp\\UriTemplate`. The Guzzle library will automatically use the PECL\n  URI template library if it is installed.\n- Url: URL parsing is now performed in `GuzzleHttp\\Url::fromString` (previously\n  it was `Guzzle\\Http\\Url::factory()`). If custom URL parsing is necessary,\n  then developers are free to subclass `GuzzleHttp\\Url`.\n\n## Plugin\n\nThe `Guzzle\\Plugin` namespace has been renamed to `GuzzleHttp\\Subscriber`.\nSeveral plugins are shipping with the core Guzzle library under this namespace.\n\n- `GuzzleHttp\\Subscriber\\Cookie`: Replaces the old CookiePlugin. Cookie jar\n  code has moved to `GuzzleHttp\\Cookie`.\n- `GuzzleHttp\\Subscriber\\History`: Replaces the old HistoryPlugin.\n- `GuzzleHttp\\Subscriber\\HttpError`: Throws errors when a bad HTTP response is\n  received.\n- `GuzzleHttp\\Subscriber\\Mock`: Replaces the old MockPlugin.\n- `GuzzleHttp\\Subscriber\\Prepare`: Prepares the body of a request just before\n  sending. This subscriber is attached to all requests by default.\n- `GuzzleHttp\\Subscriber\\Redirect`: Replaces the RedirectPlugin.\n\nThe following plugins have been removed (third-parties are free to re-implement\nthese if needed):\n\n- `GuzzleHttp\\Plugin\\Async` has been removed.\n- `GuzzleHttp\\Plugin\\CurlAuth` has been removed.\n- `GuzzleHttp\\Plugin\\ErrorResponse\\ErrorResponsePlugin` has been removed. This\n  functionality should instead be implemented with event listeners that occur\n  after normal response parsing occurs in the guzzle/command package.\n\nThe following plugins are not part of the core Guzzle package, but are provided\nin separate repositories:\n\n- `Guzzle\\Http\\Plugin\\BackoffPlugin` has been rewritten to be much simpler\n  to build custom retry policies using simple functions rather than various\n  chained classes. See: https://github.com/guzzle/retry-subscriber\n- `Guzzle\\Http\\Plugin\\Cache\\CachePlugin` has moved to\n  https://github.com/guzzle/cache-subscriber\n- `Guzzle\\Http\\Plugin\\Log\\LogPlugin` has moved to\n  https://github.com/guzzle/log-subscriber\n- `Guzzle\\Http\\Plugin\\Md5\\Md5Plugin` has moved to\n  https://github.com/guzzle/message-integrity-subscriber\n- `Guzzle\\Http\\Plugin\\Mock\\MockPlugin` has moved to\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Subscriber\\MockSubscriber`.\n- `Guzzle\\Http\\Plugin\\Oauth\\OauthPlugin` has moved to\n  https://github.com/guzzle/oauth-subscriber\n\n## Service\n\nThe service description layer of Guzzle has moved into two separate packages:\n\n- https://github.com/guzzle/command Provides a high level abstraction over web\n  services by representing web service operations using commands.\n- https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle-services Provides an implementation of\n  guzzle/command that provides request serialization and response parsing using\n  Guzzle service descriptions.\n\n## Stream\n\nStream have moved to a separate package available at\nhttps://github.com/guzzle/streams.\n\n`Guzzle\\Stream\\StreamInterface` has been given a large update to cleanly take\non the responsibilities of `Guzzle\\Http\\EntityBody` and\n`Guzzle\\Http\\EntityBodyInterface` now that they have been removed. The number\nof methods implemented by the `StreamInterface` has been drastically reduced to\nallow developers to more easily extend and decorate stream behavior.\n\n## Removed methods from StreamInterface\n\n- `getStream` and `setStream` have been removed to better encapsulate streams.\n- `getMetadata` and `setMetadata` have been removed in favor of\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Stream\\MetadataStreamInterface`.\n- `getWrapper`, `getWrapperData`, `getStreamType`, and `getUri` have all been\n  removed. This data is accessible when\n  using streams that implement `GuzzleHttp\\Stream\\MetadataStreamInterface`.\n- `rewind` has been removed. Use `seek(0)` for a similar behavior.\n\n## Renamed methods\n\n- `detachStream` has been renamed to `detach`.\n- `feof` has been renamed to `eof`.\n- `ftell` has been renamed to `tell`.\n- `readLine` has moved from an instance method to a static class method of\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Stream\\Stream`.\n\n## Metadata streams\n\n`GuzzleHttp\\Stream\\MetadataStreamInterface` has been added to denote streams\nthat contain additional metadata accessible via `getMetadata()`.\n`GuzzleHttp\\Stream\\StreamInterface::getMetadata` and\n`GuzzleHttp\\Stream\\StreamInterface::setMetadata` have been removed.\n\n## StreamRequestFactory\n\nThe entire concept of the StreamRequestFactory has been removed. The way this\nwas used in Guzzle 3 broke the actual interface of sending streaming requests\n(instead of getting back a Response, you got a StreamInterface). Streaming\nPHP requests are now implemented through the `GuzzleHttp\\Adapter\\StreamAdapter`.\n\n3.6 to 3.7\n----------\n\n### Deprecations\n\n- You can now enable E_USER_DEPRECATED warnings to see if you are using any deprecated methods.:\n\n```php\n\\Guzzle\\Common\\Version::$emitWarnings = true;\n```\n\nThe following APIs and options have been marked as deprecated:\n\n- Marked `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\Request::isResponseBodyRepeatable()` as deprecated. Use `$request->getResponseBody()->isRepeatable()` instead.\n- Marked `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\Request::canCache()` as deprecated. Use `Guzzle\\Plugin\\Cache\\DefaultCanCacheStrategy->canCacheRequest()` instead.\n- Marked `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\Request::canCache()` as deprecated. Use `Guzzle\\Plugin\\Cache\\DefaultCanCacheStrategy->canCacheRequest()` instead.\n- Marked `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\Request::setIsRedirect()` as deprecated. Use the HistoryPlugin instead.\n- Marked `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\Request::isRedirect()` as deprecated. Use the HistoryPlugin instead.\n- Marked `Guzzle\\Cache\\CacheAdapterFactory::factory()` as deprecated\n- Marked `Guzzle\\Service\\Client::enableMagicMethods()` as deprecated. Magic methods can no longer be disabled on a Guzzle\\Service\\Client.\n- Marked `Guzzle\\Parser\\Url\\UrlParser` as deprecated. Just use PHP's `parse_url()` and percent encode your UTF-8.\n- Marked `Guzzle\\Common\\Collection::inject()` as deprecated.\n- Marked `Guzzle\\Plugin\\CurlAuth\\CurlAuthPlugin` as deprecated. Use\n  `$client->getConfig()->setPath('request.options/auth', array('user', 'pass', 'Basic|Digest|NTLM|Any'));` or\n  `$client->setDefaultOption('auth', array('user', 'pass', 'Basic|Digest|NTLM|Any'));`\n\n3.7 introduces `request.options` as a parameter for a client configuration and as an optional argument to all creational\nrequest methods. When paired with a client's configuration settings, these options allow you to specify default settings\nfor various aspects of a request. Because these options make other previous configuration options redundant, several\nconfiguration options and methods of a client and AbstractCommand have been deprecated.\n\n- Marked `Guzzle\\Service\\Client::getDefaultHeaders()` as deprecated. Use `$client->getDefaultOption('headers')`.\n- Marked `Guzzle\\Service\\Client::setDefaultHeaders()` as deprecated. Use `$client->setDefaultOption('headers/{header_name}', 'value')`.\n- Marked 'request.params' for `Guzzle\\Http\\Client` as deprecated. Use `$client->setDefaultOption('params/{param_name}', 'value')`\n- Marked 'command.headers', 'command.response_body' and 'command.on_complete' as deprecated for AbstractCommand. These will work through Guzzle 4.0\n\n        $command = $client->getCommand('foo', array(\n            'command.headers' => array('Test' => '123'),\n            'command.response_body' => '/path/to/file'\n        ));\n\n        // Should be changed to:\n\n        $command = $client->getCommand('foo', array(\n            'command.request_options' => array(\n                'headers' => array('Test' => '123'),\n                'save_as' => '/path/to/file'\n            )\n        ));\n\n### Interface changes\n\nAdditions and changes (you will need to update any implementations or subclasses you may have created):\n\n- Added an `$options` argument to the end of the following methods of `Guzzle\\Http\\ClientInterface`:\n  createRequest, head, delete, put, patch, post, options, prepareRequest\n- Added an `$options` argument to the end of `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\Request\\RequestFactoryInterface::createRequest()`\n- Added an `applyOptions()` method to `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\Request\\RequestFactoryInterface`\n- Changed `Guzzle\\Http\\ClientInterface::get($uri = null, $headers = null, $body = null)` to\n  `Guzzle\\Http\\ClientInterface::get($uri = null, $headers = null, $options = array())`. You can still pass in a\n  resource, string, or EntityBody into the $options parameter to specify the download location of the response.\n- Changed `Guzzle\\Common\\Collection::__construct($data)` to no longer accepts a null value for `$data` but a\n  default `array()`\n- Added `Guzzle\\Stream\\StreamInterface::isRepeatable`\n- Made `Guzzle\\Http\\Client::expandTemplate` and `getUriTemplate` protected methods.\n\nThe following methods were removed from interfaces. All of these methods are still available in the concrete classes\nthat implement them, but you should update your code to use alternative methods:\n\n- Removed `Guzzle\\Http\\ClientInterface::setDefaultHeaders(). Use\n  `$client->getConfig()->setPath('request.options/headers/{header_name}', 'value')`. or\n  `$client->getConfig()->setPath('request.options/headers', array('header_name' => 'value'))` or\n  `$client->setDefaultOption('headers/{header_name}', 'value')`. or\n  `$client->setDefaultOption('headers', array('header_name' => 'value'))`.\n- Removed `Guzzle\\Http\\ClientInterface::getDefaultHeaders(). Use `$client->getConfig()->getPath('request.options/headers')`.\n- Removed `Guzzle\\Http\\ClientInterface::expandTemplate()`. This is an implementation detail.\n- Removed `Guzzle\\Http\\ClientInterface::setRequestFactory()`. This is an implementation detail.\n- Removed `Guzzle\\Http\\ClientInterface::getCurlMulti()`. This is a very specific implementation detail.\n- Removed `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\RequestInterface::canCache`. Use the CachePlugin.\n- Removed `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\RequestInterface::setIsRedirect`. Use the HistoryPlugin.\n- Removed `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\RequestInterface::isRedirect`. Use the HistoryPlugin.\n\n### Cache plugin breaking changes\n\n- CacheKeyProviderInterface and DefaultCacheKeyProvider are no longer used. All of this logic is handled in a\n  CacheStorageInterface. These two objects and interface will be removed in a future version.\n- Always setting X-cache headers on cached responses\n- Default cache TTLs are now handled by the CacheStorageInterface of a CachePlugin\n- `CacheStorageInterface::cache($key, Response $response, $ttl = null)` has changed to `cache(RequestInterface\n  $request, Response $response);`\n- `CacheStorageInterface::fetch($key)` has changed to `fetch(RequestInterface $request);`\n- `CacheStorageInterface::delete($key)` has changed to `delete(RequestInterface $request);`\n- Added `CacheStorageInterface::purge($url)`\n- `DefaultRevalidation::__construct(CacheKeyProviderInterface $cacheKey, CacheStorageInterface $cache, CachePlugin\n  $plugin)` has changed to `DefaultRevalidation::__construct(CacheStorageInterface $cache,\n  CanCacheStrategyInterface $canCache = null)`\n- Added `RevalidationInterface::shouldRevalidate(RequestInterface $request, Response $response)`\n\n3.5 to 3.6\n----------\n\n* Mixed casing of headers are now forced to be a single consistent casing across all values for that header.\n* Messages internally use a HeaderCollection object to delegate handling case-insensitive header resolution\n* Removed the whole changedHeader() function system of messages because all header changes now go through addHeader().\n  For example, setHeader() first removes the header using unset on a HeaderCollection and then calls addHeader().\n  Keeping the Host header and URL host in sync is now handled by overriding the addHeader method in Request.\n* Specific header implementations can be created for complex headers. When a message creates a header, it uses a\n  HeaderFactory which can map specific headers to specific header classes. There is now a Link header and\n  CacheControl header implementation.\n* Moved getLinks() from Response to just be used on a Link header object.\n\nIf you previously relied on Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\Header::raw(), then you will need to update your code to use the\nHeaderInterface (e.g. toArray(), getAll(), etc.).\n\n### Interface changes\n\n* Removed from interface: Guzzle\\Http\\ClientInterface::setUriTemplate\n* Removed from interface: Guzzle\\Http\\ClientInterface::setCurlMulti()\n* Removed Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\Request::receivedRequestHeader() and implemented this functionality in\n  Guzzle\\Http\\Curl\\RequestMediator\n* Removed the optional $asString parameter from MessageInterface::getHeader(). Just cast the header to a string.\n* Removed the optional $tryChunkedTransfer option from Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\EntityEnclosingRequestInterface\n* Removed the $asObjects argument from Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\MessageInterface::getHeaders()\n\n### Removed deprecated functions\n\n* Removed Guzzle\\Parser\\ParserRegister::get(). Use getParser()\n* Removed Guzzle\\Parser\\ParserRegister::set(). Use registerParser().\n\n### Deprecations\n\n* The ability to case-insensitively search for header values\n* Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\Header::hasExactHeader\n* Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\Header::raw. Use getAll()\n* Deprecated cache control specific methods on Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\AbstractMessage. Use the CacheControl header object\n  instead.\n\n### Other changes\n\n* All response header helper functions return a string rather than mixing Header objects and strings inconsistently\n* Removed cURL blacklist support. This is no longer necessary now that Expect, Accept, etc. are managed by Guzzle\n  directly via interfaces\n* Removed the injecting of a request object onto a response object. The methods to get and set a request still exist\n  but are a no-op until removed.\n* Most classes that used to require a `Guzzle\\Service\\Command\\CommandInterface` typehint now request a\n  `Guzzle\\Service\\Command\\ArrayCommandInterface`.\n* Added `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\RequestInterface::startResponse()` to the RequestInterface to handle injecting a response\n  on a request while the request is still being transferred\n* `Guzzle\\Service\\Command\\CommandInterface` now extends from ToArrayInterface and ArrayAccess\n\n3.3 to 3.4\n----------\n\nBase URLs of a client now follow the rules of https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-5.2.2 when merging URLs.\n\n3.2 to 3.3\n----------\n\n### Response::getEtag() quote stripping removed\n\n`Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\Response::getEtag()` no longer strips quotes around the ETag response header\n\n### Removed `Guzzle\\Http\\Utils`\n\nThe `Guzzle\\Http\\Utils` class was removed. This class was only used for testing.\n\n### Stream wrapper and type\n\n`Guzzle\\Stream\\Stream::getWrapper()` and `Guzzle\\Stream\\Stream::getStreamType()` are no longer converted to lowercase.\n\n### curl.emit_io became emit_io\n\nEmitting IO events from a RequestMediator is now a parameter that must be set in a request's curl options using the\n'emit_io' key. This was previously set under a request's parameters using 'curl.emit_io'\n\n3.1 to 3.2\n----------\n\n### CurlMulti is no longer reused globally\n\nBefore 3.2, the same CurlMulti object was reused globally for each client. This can cause issue where plugins added\nto a single client can pollute requests dispatched from other clients.\n\nIf you still wish to reuse the same CurlMulti object with each client, then you can add a listener to the\nServiceBuilder's `service_builder.create_client` event to inject a custom CurlMulti object into each client as it is\ncreated.\n\n```php\n$multi = new Guzzle\\Http\\Curl\\CurlMulti();\n$builder = Guzzle\\Service\\Builder\\ServiceBuilder::factory('/path/to/config.json');\n$builder->addListener('service_builder.create_client', function ($event) use ($multi) {\n    $event['client']->setCurlMulti($multi);\n}\n});\n```\n\n### No default path\n\nURLs no longer have a default path value of '/' if no path was specified.\n\nBefore:\n\n```php\n$request = $client->get('http://www.foo.com');\necho $request->getUrl();\n// >> http://www.foo.com/\n```\n\nAfter:\n\n```php\n$request = $client->get('http://www.foo.com');\necho $request->getUrl();\n// >> http://www.foo.com\n```\n\n### Less verbose BadResponseException\n\nThe exception message for `Guzzle\\Http\\Exception\\BadResponseException` no longer contains the full HTTP request and\nresponse information. You can, however, get access to the request and response object by calling `getRequest()` or\n`getResponse()` on the exception object.\n\n### Query parameter aggregation\n\nMulti-valued query parameters are no longer aggregated using a callback function. `Guzzle\\Http\\Query` now has a\nsetAggregator() method that accepts a `Guzzle\\Http\\QueryAggregator\\QueryAggregatorInterface` object. This object is\nresponsible for handling the aggregation of multi-valued query string variables into a flattened hash.\n\n2.8 to 3.x\n----------\n\n### Guzzle\\Service\\Inspector\n\nChange `\\Guzzle\\Service\\Inspector::fromConfig` to `\\Guzzle\\Common\\Collection::fromConfig`\n\n**Before**\n\n```php\nuse Guzzle\\Service\\Inspector;\n\nclass YourClient extends \\Guzzle\\Service\\Client\n{\n    public static function factory($config = array())\n    {\n        $default = array();\n        $required = array('base_url', 'username', 'api_key');\n        $config = Inspector::fromConfig($config, $default, $required);\n\n        $client = new self(\n            $config->get('base_url'),\n            $config->get('username'),\n            $config->get('api_key')\n        );\n        $client->setConfig($config);\n\n        $client->setDescription(ServiceDescription::factory(__DIR__ . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'client.json'));\n\n        return $client;\n    }\n```\n\n**After**\n\n```php\nuse Guzzle\\Common\\Collection;\n\nclass YourClient extends \\Guzzle\\Service\\Client\n{\n    public static function factory($config = array())\n    {\n        $default = array();\n        $required = array('base_url', 'username', 'api_key');\n        $config = Collection::fromConfig($config, $default, $required);\n\n        $client = new self(\n            $config->get('base_url'),\n            $config->get('username'),\n            $config->get('api_key')\n        );\n        $client->setConfig($config);\n\n        $client->setDescription(ServiceDescription::factory(__DIR__ . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'client.json'));\n\n        return $client;\n    }\n```\n\n### Convert XML Service Descriptions to JSON\n\n**Before**\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<client>\n    <commands>\n

And the\n`save()` and `saveHTML()` methods will take any DOMDocument.\n\n### Options\n\nIt is possible to pass in an array of configuration options when loading\nan HTML5 document.\n\n```php\n// An associative array of options\n$options = array(\n  'option_name' => 'option_value',\n);\n\n// Provide the options to the constructor\n$html5 = new HTML5($options);\n\n$dom = $html5->loadHTML($html);\n```\n\nThe following options are supported:\n\n* `encode_entities` (boolean): Indicates that the serializer should aggressively\n  encode characters as entities. Without this, it only encodes the bare\n  minimum.\n* `disable_html_ns` (boolean): Prevents the parser from automatically\n  assigning the HTML5 namespace to the DOM document. This is for\n  non-namespace aware DOM tools.\n* `target_document` (\\DOMDocument): A DOM document that will be used as the\n  destination for the parsed nodes.\n* `implicit_namespaces` (array): An assoc array of namespaces that should be\n  used by the parser. Name is tag prefix, value is NS URI.\n\n## The Low-Level API\n\nThis library provides the following low-level APIs that you can use to\ncreate more customized HTML5 tools:\n\n- A SAX-like event-based parser that you can hook into for special kinds\nof parsing.\n- A flexible error-reporting mechanism that can be tuned to document\nsyntax checking.\n- A DOM implementation that uses PHP's built-in DOM library.\n\nThe unit tests exercise each piece of the API, and every public function\nis well-documented.\n\n### Parser Design\n\nThe parser is designed as follows:\n\n- The `Scanner` handles scanning on behalf of the parser.\n- The `Tokenizer` requests data off of the scanner, parses it, clasifies\nit, and sends it to an `EventHandler`. It is a *recursive descent parser.*\n- The `EventHandler` receives notifications and data for each specific\nsemantic event that occurs during tokenization.\n- The `DOMBuilder` is an `EventHandler` that listens for tokenizing\nevents and builds a document tree (`DOMDocument`) based on the events.\n\n### Serializer Design\n\nThe serializer takes a data structure (the `DOMDocument`) and transforms\nit into a character representation -- an HTML5 document.\n\nThe serializer is broken into three parts:\n\n- The `OutputRules` contain the rules to turn DOM elements into strings. The\nrules are an implementation of the interface `RulesInterface` allowing for\ndifferent rule sets to be used.\n- The `Traverser`, which is a special-purpose tree walker. It visits\neach node node in the tree and uses the `OutputRules` to transform the node\ninto a string.\n- `HTML5` manages the `Traverser` and stores the resultant data\nin the correct place.\n\nThe serializer (`save()`, `saveHTML()`) follows the\n[section 8.9 of the HTML 5.0 spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/CR-html5-20121217/syntax.html#serializing-html-fragments).\nSo tags are serialized according to these rules:\n\n- A tag with children: &lt;foo&gt;CHILDREN&lt;/foo&gt;\n- A tag that cannot have content: &lt;foo&gt; (no closing tag)\n- A tag that could have content, but doesn't: &lt;foo&gt;&lt;/foo&gt;\n\n## Known Issues (Or, Things We Designed Against the Spec)\n\nPlease check the issue queue for a full list, but the following are\nissues known issues that are not presently on the roadmap:\n\n- Namespaces: HTML5 only [supports a selected list of namespaces](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#namespaces)\n  and they do not operate in the same way as XML namespaces. A `:` has no special\n  meaning.\n  By default the parser does not support XML style namespaces via `:`;\n  to enable the XML namespaces see the  [XML Namespaces section](#xml-namespaces)\n- Scripts: This parser does not contain a JavaScript or a CSS\n  interpreter. While one may be supplied, not all features will be\n  supported.\n- Reentrance: The current parser is not re-entrant. (Thus you can't pause\n  the parser to modify the HTML string mid-parse.)\n- Validation: The current tree builder is **not** a validating parser.\n  While it will correct some HTML, it does not check that the HTML\n  conforms to the standard. (Should you wish, you can build a validating\n  parser by extending DOMTree or building your own EventHandler\n  implementation.)\n  * There is limited support for insertion modes.\n  * Some autocorrection is done automatically.\n  * Per the spec, many legacy tags are admitted and correctly handled,\n    even though they are technically not part of HTML5.\n- Attribute names and values: Due to the implementation details of the\n  PHP implementation of DOM, attribute names that do not follow the\n  XML 1.0 standard are not inserted into the DOM. (Effectively, they\n  are ignored.) If you've got a clever fix for this, jump in!\n- Processor Instructions: The HTML5 spec does not allow processor\n  instructions. We do. Since this is a server-side library, we think\n  this is useful. And that means, dear reader, that in some cases you\n  can parse the HTML from a mixed PHP/HTML document. This, however,\n  is an incidental feature, not a core feature.\n- HTML manifests: Unsupported.\n- PLAINTEXT: Unsupported.\n- Adoption Agency Algorithm: Not yet implemented. (8.2.5.4.7)\n\n## XML Namespaces\n\nTo use XML style namespaces you have to configure well the main `HTML5` instance.\n\n```php\nuse Masterminds\\HTML5;\n$html = new HTML5(array(\n    \"xmlNamespaces\" => true\n));\n\n$dom = $html->loadHTML('<t:tag xmlns:t=\"http://www.example.com\"/>');\n\n$dom->documentElement->namespaceURI; // http://www.example.com\n\n```\n\nYou can also add some default prefixes that will not require the namespace declaration,\nbut its elements will be namespaced.\n\n```php\nuse Masterminds\\HTML5;\n$html = new HTML5(array(\n    \"implicitNamespaces\"=>array(\n        \"t\"=>\"http://www.example.com\"\n    )\n));\n\n$dom = $html->loadHTML('<t:tag/>');\n\n$dom->documentElement->namespaceURI; // http://www.example.com\n\n```\n\n## Thanks to...\n\nThe dedicated (and patient) contributors of patches small and large,\nwho have already made this library better.See the CREDITS file for\na list of contributors.\n\nWe owe a huge debt of gratitude to the original authors of html5lib.\n\nWhile not much of the original parser remains, we learned a lot from\nreading the html5lib library. And some pieces remain here. In\nparticular, much of the UTF-8 and Unicode handling is derived from the\nhtml5lib project.\n\n## License\n\nThis software is released under the MIT license.

interfaces to use\n  `@return static`, which more closelly follows the semantics of the\n  specification.\n- Updated the `MessageInterface::getHeaders()` return annotation to use the\n  value `string[][]`, indicating the format is a nested array of strings.\n- Updated the `@link` annotation for `RequestInterface::withRequestTarget()`\n  to point to the correct section of RFC 7230.\n- Updated the `ServerRequestInterface::withUploadedFiles()` parameter annotation\n  to add the parameter name (`$uploadedFiles`).\n- Updated a `@throws` annotation for the `UploadedFileInterface::moveTo()`\n  method to correctly reference the method parameter (it was referencing an\n  incorrect parameter name previously).\n\n## 1.0.0 - 2016-05-18\n\nInitial stable

Guzzle Promises\n\n[Promises/A+](https://promisesaplus.com/) implementation that handles promise\nchaining and resolution iteratively, allowing for \"infinite\" promise chaining\nwhile keeping the stack size constant.

The\nprimary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\nregisters callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\nwhy the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n### Callbacks\n\nCallbacks are registered with the `then` method by providing an optional \n`$onFulfilled` followed by an optional `$onRejected` function.\n\n\n```php\nuse GuzzleHttp\\Promise\\Promise;\n\n$promise = new Promise();\n$promise->then(\n    // $onFulfilled\n    function ($value) {\n        echo 'The promise was fulfilled.';\n    },\n    // $onRejected\n    function ($reason) {\n        echo 'The promise was rejected.';\n    }\n);\n```\n\n*Resolving* a promise means that you either fulfill a promise with a *value* or\nreject a promise with a *reason*. Resolving a promise triggers callbacks\nregistered with the promise's `then` method. These callbacks are triggered\nonly once and in the order in which they were added.\n\n### Resolving a Promise\n\nPromises are fulfilled using the `resolve($value)` method. Resolving a promise\nwith any value other than a `GuzzleHttp\\Promise\\RejectedPromise` will trigger\nall of the onFulfilled callbacks (resolving a promise with a rejected promise\nwill reject the promise and trigger the `$onRejected` callbacks).\n\n```php\nuse GuzzleHttp\\Promise\\Promise;\n\n$promise = new Promise();\n$promise\n    ->then(function ($value) {\n        // Return a value and don't break the chain\n        return \"Hello, \" . $value;\n    })\n    // This then is executed after the first then and receives the value\n    // returned from the first then.\n    ->then(function ($value) {\n        echo $value;\n    });\n\n// Resolving the promise triggers the $onFulfilled callbacks and outputs\n// \"Hello, reader.\"\n$promise->resolve('reader.');\n```\n\n### Promise Forwarding\n\nPromises can be chained one after the other. Each then in the chain is a new\npromise. The return value of a promise is what's forwarded to the next\npromise in the chain. Returning a promise in a `then` callback will cause the\nsubsequent promises in the chain to only be fulfilled when the returned promise\nhas been fulfilled. The next promise in the chain will be invoked with the\nresolved value of the promise.\n\n```php\nuse GuzzleHttp\\Promise\\Promise;\n\n$promise = new Promise();\n$nextPromise = new Promise();\n\n$promise\n    ->then(function ($value) use ($nextPromise) {\n        echo $value;\n        return $nextPromise;\n    })\n    ->then(function ($value) {\n        echo $value;\n    });\n\n// Triggers the first callback and outputs \"A\"\n$promise->resolve('A');\n// Triggers the second callback and outputs \"B\"\n$nextPromise->resolve('B');\n```\n\n### Promise Rejection\n\nWhen a promise is rejected, the `$onRejected` callbacks are invoked with the\nrejection reason.\n\n```php\nuse GuzzleHttp\\Promise\\Promise;\n\n$promise = new Promise();\n$promise->then(null, function ($reason) {\n    echo $reason;\n});\n\n$promise->reject('Error!');\n// Outputs \"Error!\"\n```\n\n### Rejection Forwarding\n\nIf an exception is thrown in an `$onRejected` callback, subsequent\n`$onRejected` callbacks are invoked with the thrown exception as the reason.\n\n```php\nuse GuzzleHttp\\Promise\\Promise;\n\n$promise = new Promise();\n$promise->then(null, function ($reason) {\n    throw new Exception($reason);\n})->then(null, function ($reason) {\n    assert($reason->getMessage() === 'Error!');\n});\n\n$promise->reject('Error!');\n```\n\nYou can also forward a rejection down the promise chain by returning a\n`GuzzleHttp\\Promise\\RejectedPromise` in either an `$onFulfilled` or\n`$onRejected` callback.\n\n```php\nuse GuzzleHttp\\Promise\\Promise;\nuse GuzzleHttp\\Promise\\RejectedPromise;\n\n$promise = new Promise();\n$promise->then(null, function ($reason) {\n    return new RejectedPromise($reason);\n})->then(null, function ($reason) {\n    assert($reason === 'Error!');\n});\n\n$promise->reject('Error!');\n```\n\nIf an exception is not thrown in a `$onRejected` callback and the callback\ndoes not return a rejected promise, downstream `$onFulfilled` callbacks are\ninvoked using the value returned from the `$onRejected` callback.\n\n```php\nuse GuzzleHttp\\Promise\\Promise;\n\n$promise = new Promise();\n$promise\n    ->then(null, function ($reason) {\n        return \"It's ok\";\n    })\n    ->then(function ($value) {\n        assert($value === \"It's ok\");\n    });\n\n$promise->reject('Error!');\n```\n\n\n## Synchronous Wait\n\nYou can synchronously force promises to complete using a promise's `wait`\nmethod. When creating a promise, you can provide a wait function that is used\nto synchronously force a promise to complete. When a wait function is invoked\nit is expected to deliver a value to the promise or reject the promise. If the\nwait function does not deliver a value, then an exception is thrown. The wait\nfunction provided to a promise constructor is invoked when the `wait` function\nof the promise is called.\n\n```php\n$promise = new Promise(function () use (&$promise) {\n    $promise->resolve('foo');\n});\n\n// Calling wait will return the value of the promise.\necho $promise->wait(); // outputs \"foo\"\n```\n\nIf an exception is encountered while invoking the wait function of a promise,\nthe promise is rejected with the exception and the exception is thrown.\n\n```php\n$promise = new Promise(function () use (&$promise) {\n    throw new Exception('foo');\n});\n\n$promise->wait(); // throws the exception.\n```\n\nCalling `wait` on a promise that has been fulfilled will not trigger the wait\nfunction. It will simply return the previously resolved value.\n\n```php\n$promise = new Promise(function () { die('this is not called!'); });\n$promise->resolve('foo');\necho $promise->wait(); // outputs \"foo\"\n```\n\nCalling `wait` on a promise that has been rejected will throw an exception. If\nthe rejection reason is an instance of `\\Exception` the reason is thrown.\nOtherwise, a `GuzzleHttp\\Promise\\RejectionException` is thrown and the reason\ncan be obtained by calling the `getReason` method of the exception.\n\n```php\n$promise = new Promise();\n$promise->reject('foo');\n$promise->wait();\n```\n\n> PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught exception 'GuzzleHttp\\Promise\\RejectionException' with message 'The promise was rejected with value: foo'\n\n### Unwrapping a Promise\n\nWhen synchronously waiting on a promise, you are joining the state of the\npromise into the current state of execution (i.e., return the value of the\npromise if it was fulfilled or throw an exception if it was rejected). This is\ncalled \"unwrapping\" the promise. Waiting on a promise will by default unwrap\nthe promise state.\n\nYou can force a promise to resolve and *not* unwrap the state of the promise\nby passing `false` to the first argument of the `wait` function:\n\n```php\n$promise = new Promise();\n$promise->reject('foo');\n// This will not throw an exception. It simply ensures the promise has\n// been resolved.\n$promise->wait(false);\n```\n\nWhen unwrapping a promise, the resolved value of the promise will be waited\nupon until the unwrapped value is not a promise. This means that if you resolve\npromise A with a promise B and unwrap promise A, the value returned by the\nwait function will be the value delivered to promise B.\n\n**Note**: when you do not unwrap the promise, no value is returned.\n\n\n## Cancellation\n\nYou can cancel a promise that has not yet been fulfilled using the `cancel()`\nmethod of a promise. When creating a promise you can provide an optional\ncancel function that when invoked cancels the action of computing a resolution\nof the promise.\n\n\n## API\n\n### Promise\n\nWhen creating a promise object, you can provide an optional `$waitFn` and\n`$cancelFn`. `$waitFn` is a function that is invoked with no arguments and is\nexpected to resolve the promise. `$cancelFn` is a function with no arguments\nthat is expected to cancel the computation of a promise. It is invoked when the\n`cancel()` method of a promise is called.\n\n```php\nuse GuzzleHttp\\Promise\\Promise;\n\n$promise = new Promise(\n    function () use (&$promise) {\n        $promise->resolve('waited');\n    },\n    function () {\n        // do something that will cancel the promise computation (e.g., close\n        // a socket, cancel a database query, etc...)\n    }\n);\n\nassert('waited' === $promise->wait());\n```\n\nA promise has the following methods:\n\n- `then(callable $onFulfilled, callable $onRejected) : PromiseInterface`\n  \n  Appends fulfillment and rejection handlers to the promise, and returns a new promise resolving to the return value of the called handler.\n\n- `otherwise(callable $onRejected) : PromiseInterface`\n  \n  Appends a rejection handler callback to the promise, and returns a new promise resolving to the return value of the callback if it is called, or to its original fulfillment value if the promise is instead fulfilled.\n\n- `wait($unwrap = true) : mixed`\n\n  Synchronously waits on the promise to complete.\n  \n  `$unwrap` controls whether or not the value of the promise is returned for a\n  fulfilled promise or if an exception is thrown if the promise is rejected.\n  This is set to `true` by default.\n\n- `cancel()`\n\n  Attempts to cancel the promise if possible. The promise being cancelled and\n  the parent most ancestor that has not yet been resolved will also be\n  cancelled. Any promises waiting on the cancelled promise to resolve will also\n  be cancelled.\n\n- `getState() : string`\n\n  Returns the state of the promise. One of `pending`, `fulfilled`, or\n  `rejected`.\n\n- `resolve($value)`\n\n  Fulfills the promise with the given `$value`.\n\n- `reject($reason)`\n\n  Rejects the promise with the given `$reason`.\n\n\n### FulfilledPromise\n\nA fulfilled promise can be created to represent a promise that has been\nfulfilled.\n\n```php\nuse GuzzleHttp\\Promise\\FulfilledPromise;\n\n$promise = new FulfilledPromise('value');\n\n// Fulfilled callbacks are immediately invoked.\n$promise->then(function ($value) {\n    echo $value;\n});\n```\n\n\n### RejectedPromise\n\nA rejected promise can be created to represent a promise that has been\nrejected.\n\n```php\nuse GuzzleHttp\\Promise\\RejectedPromise;\n\n$promise = new RejectedPromise('Error');\n\n// Rejected callbacks are immediately invoked.\n$promise->then(null, function ($reason) {\n    echo $reason;\n});\n```\n\n\n## Promise Interoperability\n\nThis library works with foreign promises that have a `then` method. This means\nyou can use Guzzle promises with [React promises](https://github.com/reactphp/promise)\nfor example. When a foreign promise is returned inside of a then method\ncallback, promise resolution will occur recursively.\n\n```php\n// Create a React promise\n$deferred = new React\\Promise\\Deferred();\n$reactPromise = $deferred->promise();\n\n// Create a Guzzle promise that is fulfilled with a React promise.\n$guzzlePromise = new GuzzleHttp\\Promise\\Promise();\n$guzzlePromise->then(function ($value) use ($reactPromise) {\n    // Do something something with the value...\n    // Return the React promise\n    return $reactPromise;\n});\n```\n\nPlease note that wait and cancel chaining is no longer possible when forwarding\na foreign promise. You will need to wrap a third-party promise with a Guzzle\npromise in order to utilize wait and cancel functions with foreign promises.\n\n\n### Event Loop Integration\n\nIn order to keep the stack size constant, Guzzle promises are resolved\nasynchronously using a task queue. When waiting on promises synchronously, the\ntask queue will be automatically run to ensure that the blocking promise and\nany forwarded promises are resolved. When using promises asynchronously in an\nevent loop, you will need to run the task queue on each tick of the loop. If\nyou do not run the task queue, then promises will not be resolved.\n\nYou can run the task queue using the `run()` method of the global task queue\ninstance.\n\n```php\n// Get the global task queue\n$queue = GuzzleHttp\\Promise\\Utils::queue();\n$queue->run();\n```\n\nFor example, you could use Guzzle promises with React using a periodic timer:\n\n```php\n$loop = React\\EventLoop\\Factory::create();\n$loop->addPeriodicTimer(0, [$queue, 'run']);\n```\n\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Promise Resolution and Chaining is Handled Iteratively\n\nBy shuffling pending handlers from one owner to another, promises are\nresolved iteratively, allowing for \"infinite\" then chaining.\n\n```php\n<?php\nrequire 'vendor/autoload.php';\n\nuse GuzzleHttp\\Promise\\Promise;\n\n$parent = new Promise();\n$p = $parent;\n\nfor ($i = 0; $i < 1000; $i++) {\n    $p = $p->then(function ($v) {\n        // The stack size remains constant (a good thing)\n        echo xdebug_get_stack_depth() . ', ';\n        return $v + 1;\n    });\n}\n\n$parent->resolve(0);\nvar_dump($p->wait()); // int(1000)\n\n```\n\nWhen a promise is fulfilled or rejected with a non-promise value, the promise\nthen takes ownership of the handlers of each child promise and delivers values\ndown the chain without using recursion.\n\nWhen a promise is resolved with another promise, the original promise transfers\nall of its pending handlers to the new promise. When the new promise is\neventually resolved, all of the pending handlers are delivered the forwarded\nvalue.\n\n### A Promise is the Deferred\n\nSome promise libraries implement promises using a deferred object to represent\na computation and a promise object to represent the delivery of the result of\nthe computation. This is a nice separation of computation and delivery because\nconsumers of the promise cannot modify the value that will be eventually\ndelivered.\n\nOne side effect of being able to implement promise resolution and chaining\niteratively is that you need to be able for one promise to reach into the state\nof another promise to shuffle around ownership of handlers. In order to achieve\nthis without making the handlers of a promise publicly mutable, a promise is\nalso the deferred value, allowing promises of the same parent class to reach\ninto and modify the private properties of promises of the same type. While this\ndoes allow consumers of the value to modify the resolution or rejection of the\ndeferred, it is a small price to pay for keeping the stack size constant.\n\n```php\n$promise = new Promise();\n$promise->then(function ($value) { echo $value; });\n// The promise is the deferred value, so you can deliver a value to it.\n$promise->resolve('foo');\n// prints \"foo\"\n```\n\n\n## Upgrading from Function API\n\nA static API was first introduced in 1.4.0, in order to mitigate problems with\nfunctions conflicting between global and local copies of the package. The\nfunction API was removed in 2.0.0.

(eg: zendframework/zend-diactoros, guzzlehttp/psr7, slim/slim, etc)\nAll PSR-7 implementations should have the same behaviour.\n\nThe following will be assumed: \n`$request` is an object of `Psr\\Http\\Message\\RequestInterface` and\n\n`$response` is an object implementing `Psr\\Http\\Message\\RequestInterface`\n\n\n### Working with HTTP Headers\n\n#### Adding headers to response:\n\n```php\n$response->withHeader('My-Custom-Header', 'My Custom Message');\n```\n\n#### Appending values to headers\n\n```php\n$response->withAddedHeader('My-Custom-Header', 'The second message');\n```\n\n#### Checking if header exists:\n\n```php\n$request->hasHeader('My-Custom-Header'); // will return false\n$response->hasHeader('My-Custom-Header'); // will return true\n```\n\n> Note: My-Custom-Header was only added in the Response\n\n#### Getting comma-separated values from a header (also applies to request)\n\n```php\n// getting value from request headers\n$request->getHeaderLine('Content-Type'); // will return: \"text/html; charset=UTF-8\"\n// getting value from response headers\n$response->getHeaderLine('My-Custom-Header'); // will return:  \"My Custom Message; The second message\"\n```\n\n#### Getting array of value from a header (also applies to request)\n```php\n// getting value from request headers\n$request->getHeader('Content-Type'); // will return: [\"text/html\", \"charset=UTF-8\"]\n// getting value from response headers\n$response->getHeader('My-Custom-Header'); // will return:  [\"My Custom Message\",  \"The second message\"]\n```\n\n#### Removing headers from HTTP Messages\n```php\n// removing a header from Request, removing deprecated \"Content-MD5\" header\n$request->withoutHeader('Content-MD5'); \n\n// removing a header from Response\n// effect: the browser won't know the size of the stream\n// the browser will download the stream till it ends\n$response->withoutHeader('Content-Length');\n```\n\n### Working with HTTP Message Body\n\nWhen working with the PSR-7 there are two methods of implementation:\n#### 1. Getting the body separately\n\n> This method makes the body handling easier to understand and is useful when repeatedly calling body methods. (You only call `getBody()` once). Using this method mistakes like `$response->write()` are also prevented.\n\n```php\n$body = $response->getBody();\n// operations on body, eg. read, write, seek\n// ...\n// replacing the old body\n$response->withBody($body); \n// this last statement is optional as we working with objects\n// in this case the \"new\" body is same with the \"old\" one\n// the $body variable has the same value as the one in $request, only the reference is passed\n```\n\n#### 2. Working directly on response\n\n> This method is useful when only performing few operations as the `$request->getBody()` statement fragment is required\n\n```php\n$response->getBody()->write('hello');\n```\n\n### Getting the body contents\n\nThe following snippet gets the contents of a stream contents.\n> Note: Streams must be rewinded, if content was written into streams, it will be ignored when calling `getContents()` because the stream pointer is set to the last character, which is `\\0` - meaning end of stream.\n```php \n$body = $response->getBody();\n$body->rewind(); // or $body->seek(0);\n$bodyText = $body->getContents();\n```\n> Note: If `$body->seek(1)` is called before `$body->getContents()`, the first character will be ommited as the starting pointer is set to `1`, not `0`. This is why using `$body->rewind()` is recommended.\n\n### Append to body\n\n```php\n$response->getBody()->write('Hello'); // writing directly\n$body = $request->getBody(); // which is a `StreamInterface`\n$body->write('xxxxx');\n```\n\n### Prepend to body\nPrepending is different when it comes to streams. The content must be copied before writing the content to be prepended.\nThe following example will explain the behaviour of streams.\n\n```php\n// assuming our response is initially empty\n$body = $repsonse->getBody();\n// writing the string \"abcd\"\n$body->write('abcd');\n\n// seeking to start of stream\n$body->seek(0);\n// writing 'ef'\n$body->write('ef'); // at this point the stream contains \"efcd\"\n```\n\n#### Prepending by rewriting separately\n\n```php\n// assuming our response body stream only contains: \"abcd\"\n$body = $response->getBody();\n$body->rewind();\n$contents = $body->getContents(); // abcd\n// seeking the stream to beginning\n$body->rewind();\n$body->write('ef'); // stream contains \"efcd\"\n$body->write($contents); // stream contains \"efabcd\"\n```\n\n> Note: `getContents()` seeks the stream while reading it, therefore if the second `rewind()` method call was not present the stream would have resulted in `abcdefabcd` because the `write()` method appends to stream if not preceeded by `rewind()` or `seek(0)`.\n\n#### Prepending by using contents as a string\n```php\n$body = $response->getBody();\n$body->rewind();\n$contents = $body->getContents(); // efabcd\n$contents = 'ef'.$contents;\n$body->rewind();\n$body->write($contents);\n```\n","size_bytes":5492},"vendor/voku/simple_html_dom/src/voku/helper/SimpleXmlDomInterface.php":{"content":"<?php\n\nnamespace

2015-07-04\n\n* Fixed a memory leak in the curl handlers in which references to callbacks\n  were not being removed by `curl_reset`.\n* Cookies are now extracted properly before redirects.\n* Cookies now allow more character ranges.\n* Decoded Content-Encoding responses are now modified to correctly reflect\n  their state if the encoding was automatically removed by a handler. This\n  means that the `Content-Encoding` header may be removed an the\n  `Content-Length` modified to reflect the message size after removing the\n  encoding.\n* Added a more explicit error message when trying to use `form_params` and\n  `multipart` in the same request.\n* Several fixes for HHVM support.\n* Functions are now conditionally required using an additional level of\n  indirection to help with global Composer installations.\n\n\n## 6.0.1 - 2015-05-27\n\n* Fixed a bug with serializing the `query` request option where the `&`\n  separator was missing.\n* Added a better error message for when `body` is provided as an array. Please\n  use `form_params` or `multipart` instead.\n* Various doc fixes.\n\n\n## 6.0.0 - 2015-05-26\n\n* See the UPGRADING.md document for more information.\n* Added `multipart` and `form_params` request options.\n* Added `synchronous` request option.\n* Added the `on_headers` request option.\n* Fixed `expect` handling.\n* No longer adding default middlewares in the client ctor. These need to be\n  present on the provided handler in order to work.\n* Requests are no longer initiated when sending async requests with the\n  CurlMultiHandler. This prevents unexpected recursion from requests completing\n  while ticking the cURL loop.\n* Removed the semantics of setting `default` to `true`. This is no longer\n  required now that the cURL loop is not ticked for async requests.\n* Added request and response logging middleware.\n* No longer allowing self signed certificates when using the StreamHandler.\n* Ensuring that `sink` is valid if saving to a file.\n* Request exceptions now include a \"handler context\" which provides handler\n  specific contextual information.\n* Added `GuzzleHttp\\RequestOptions` to allow request options to be applied\n  using constants.\n* `$maxHandles` has been removed from CurlMultiHandler.\n* `MultipartPostBody` is now part of the `guzzlehttp/psr7` package.\n\n\n## 5.3.0 - 2015-05-19\n\n* Mock now supports `save_to`\n* Marked `AbstractRequestEvent::getTransaction()` as public.\n* Fixed a bug in which multiple headers using different casing would overwrite\n  previous headers in the associative array.\n* Added `Utils::getDefaultHandler()`\n* Marked `GuzzleHttp\\Client::getDefaultUserAgent` as deprecated.\n* URL scheme is now always lowercased.\n\n\n## 6.0.0-beta.1\n\n* Requires PHP >= 5.5\n* Updated to use PSR-7\n  * Requires immutable messages, which basically means an event based system\n    owned by a request instance is no longer possible.\n  * Utilizing the [Guzzle PSR-7 package](https://github.com/guzzle/psr7).\n  * Removed the dependency on `guzzlehttp/streams`. These stream abstractions\n    are available in the `guzzlehttp/psr7` package under the `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7`\n    namespace.\n* Added middleware and handler system\n  * Replaced the Guzzle event and subscriber system with a middleware system.\n  * No longer depends on RingPHP, but rather places the HTTP handlers directly\n    in Guzzle, operating on PSR-7 messages.\n  * Retry logic is now encapsulated in `GuzzleHttp\\Middleware::retry`, which\n    means the `guzzlehttp/retry-subscriber` is now obsolete.\n  * Mocking responses is now handled using `GuzzleHttp\\Handler\\MockHandler`.\n* Asynchronous responses\n  * No longer supports the `future` request option to send an async request.\n    Instead, use one of the `*Async` methods of a client (e.g., `requestAsync`,\n    `getAsync`, etc.).\n  * Utilizing `GuzzleHttp\\Promise` instead of React's promise library to avoid\n    recursion required by chaining and forwarding react promises. See\n    https://github.com/guzzle/promises\n  * Added `requestAsync` and `sendAsync` to send request asynchronously.\n  * Added magic methods for `getAsync()`, `postAsync()`, etc. to send requests\n    asynchronously.\n* Request options\n  * POST and form updates\n    * Added the `form_fields` and `form_files` request options.\n    * Removed the `GuzzleHttp\\Post` namespace.\n    * The `body` request option no longer accepts an array for POST requests.\n  * The `exceptions` request option has been deprecated in favor of the\n    `http_errors` request options.\n  * The `save_to` request option has been deprecated in favor of `sink` request\n    option.\n* Clients no longer accept an array of URI template string and variables for\n  URI variables. You will need to expand URI templates before passing them\n  into a client constructor or request method.\n* Client methods `get()`, `post()`, `put()`, `patch()`, `options()`, etc. are\n  now magic methods that will send synchronous requests.\n* Replaced `Utils.php` with plain functions in `functions.php`.\n* Removed `GuzzleHttp\\Collection`.\n* Removed `GuzzleHttp\\BatchResults`. Batched pool results are now returned as\n  an array.\n* Removed `GuzzleHttp\\Query`. Query string handling is now handled using an\n  associative array passed into the `query` request option. The query string\n  is serialized using PHP's `http_build_query`. If you need more control, you\n  can pass the query string in as a string.\n* `GuzzleHttp\\QueryParser` has been replaced with the\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\parse_query`.\n\n\n## 5.2.0 - 2015-01-27\n\n* Added `AppliesHeadersInterface` to make applying headers to a request based\n  on the body more generic and not specific to `PostBodyInterface`.\n* Reduced the number of stack frames needed to send requests.\n* Nested futures are now resolved in the client rather than the RequestFsm\n* Finishing state transitions is now handled in the RequestFsm rather than the\n  RingBridge.\n* Added a guard in the Pool class to not use recursion for request retries.\n\n\n## 5.1.0 - 2014-12-19\n\n* Pool class no longer uses recursion when a request is intercepted.\n* The size of a Pool can now be dynamically adjusted using a callback.\n  See https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/pull/943.\n* Setting a request option to `null` when creating a request with a client will\n  ensure that the option is not set. This allows you to overwrite default\n  request options on a per-request basis.\n  See https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/pull/937.\n* Added the ability to limit which protocols are allowed for redirects by\n  specifying a `protocols` array in the `allow_redirects` request option.\n* Nested futures due to retries are now resolved when waiting for synchronous\n  responses. See https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/pull/947.\n* `\"0\"` is now an allowed URI path. See\n  https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/pull/935.\n* `Query` no longer typehints on the `$query` argument in the constructor,\n  allowing for strings and arrays.\n* Exceptions thrown in the `end` event are now correctly wrapped with Guzzle\n  specific exceptions if necessary.\n\n\n## 5.0.3 - 2014-11-03\n\nThis change updates query strings so that they are treated as un-encoded values\nby default where the value represents an un-encoded value to send over the\nwire. A Query object then encodes the value before sending over the wire. This\nmeans that even value query string values (e.g., \":\") are url encoded. This\nmakes the Query class match PHP's http_build_query function. However, if you\nwant to send requests over the wire using valid query string characters that do\nnot need to be encoded, then you can provide a string to Url::setQuery() and\npass true as the second argument to specify that the query string is a raw\nstring that should not be parsed or encoded (unless a call to getQuery() is\nsubsequently made, forcing the query-string to be converted into a Query\nobject).\n\n\n## 5.0.2 - 2014-10-30\n\n* Added a trailing `\\r\\n` to multipart/form-data payloads. See\n  https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/pull/871\n* Added a `GuzzleHttp\\Pool::send()` convenience method to match the docs.\n* Status codes are now returned as integers. See\n  https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/881\n* No longer overwriting an existing `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` header\n  when sending POST requests, allowing for customized headers. See\n  https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/877\n* Improved path URL serialization.\n\n  * No longer double percent-encoding characters in the path or query string if\n    they are already encoded.\n  * Now properly encoding the supplied path to a URL object, instead of only\n    encoding ' ' and '?'.\n  * Note: This has been changed in 5.0.3 to now encode query string values by\n    default unless the `rawString` argument is provided when setting the query\n    string on a URL: Now allowing many more characters to be present in the\n    query string without being percent encoded. See\n    https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#appendix-A\n\n\n## 5.0.1 - 2014-10-16\n\nBugfix release.\n\n* Fixed an issue where connection errors still returned response object in\n  error and end events event though the response is unusable. This has been\n  corrected so that a response is not returned in the `getResponse` method of\n  these events if the response did not complete. https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/867\n* Fixed an issue where transfer statistics were not being populated in the\n  RingBridge. https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/866\n\n\n## 5.0.0 - 2014-10-12\n\nAdding support for non-blocking responses and some minor API cleanup.\n\n### New Features\n\n* Added support for non-blocking responses based on `guzzlehttp/guzzle-ring`.\n* Added a public API for creating a default HTTP adapter.\n* Updated the redirect plugin to be non-blocking so that redirects are sent\n  concurrently. Other plugins like this can now be updated to be non-blocking.\n* Added a \"progress\" event so that you can get upload and download progress\n  events.\n* Added `GuzzleHttp\\Pool` which implements FutureInterface and transfers\n  requests concurrently using a capped pool size as efficiently as possible.\n* Added `hasListeners()` to EmitterInterface.\n* Removed `GuzzleHttp\\ClientInterface::sendAll` and marked\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Client::sendAll` as deprecated (it's still there, just not the\n  recommended way).\n\n### Breaking changes\n\nThe breaking changes in this release are relatively minor. The biggest thing to\nlook out for is that request and response objects no longer implement fluent\ninterfaces.\n\n* Removed the fluent interfaces (i.e., `return $this`) from requests,\n  responses, `GuzzleHttp\\Collection`, `GuzzleHttp\\Url`,\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Query`, `GuzzleHttp\\Post\\PostBody`, and\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Cookie\\SetCookie`. This blog post provides a good outline of\n  why I did this: https://ocramius.github.io/blog/fluent-interfaces-are-evil/.\n  This also makes the Guzzle message interfaces compatible with the current\n  PSR-7 message proposal.\n* Removed \"functions.php\", so that Guzzle is truly PSR-4 compliant. Except\n  for the HTTP request functions from function.php, these functions are now\n  implemented in `GuzzleHttp\\Utils` using camelCase. `GuzzleHttp\\json_decode`\n  moved to `GuzzleHttp\\Utils::jsonDecode`. `GuzzleHttp\\get_path` moved to\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Utils::getPath`. `GuzzleHttp\\set_path` moved to\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Utils::setPath`. `GuzzleHttp\\batch` should now be\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Pool::batch`, which returns an `objectStorage`. Using functions.php\n  caused problems for many users: they aren't PSR-4 compliant, require an\n  explicit include, and needed an if-guard to ensure that the functions are not\n  declared multiple times.\n* Rewrote adapter layer.\n    * Removing all classes from `GuzzleHttp\\Adapter`, these are now\n      implemented as callables that are stored in `GuzzleHttp\\Ring\\Client`.\n    * Removed the concept of \"parallel adapters\". Sending requests serially or\n      concurrently is now handled using a single adapter.\n    * Moved `GuzzleHttp\\Adapter\\Transaction` to `GuzzleHttp\\Transaction`. The\n      Transaction object now exposes the request, response, and client as public\n      properties. The getters and setters have been removed.\n* Removed the \"headers\" event. This event was only useful for changing the\n  body a response once the headers of the response were known. You can implement\n  a similar behavior in a number of ways. One example might be to use a\n  FnStream that has access to the transaction being sent. For example, when the\n  first byte is written, you could check if the response headers match your\n  expectations, and if so, change the actual stream body that is being\n  written to.\n* Removed the `asArray` parameter from\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Message\\MessageInterface::getHeader`. If you want to get a header\n  value as an array, then use the newly added `getHeaderAsArray()` method of\n  `MessageInterface`. This change makes the Guzzle interfaces compatible with\n  the PSR-7 interfaces.\n* `GuzzleHttp\\Message\\MessageFactory` no longer allows subclasses to add\n  custom request options using double-dispatch (this was an implementation\n  detail). Instead, you should now provide an associative array to the\n  constructor which is a mapping of the request option name mapping to a\n  function that applies the option value to a request.\n* Removed the concept of \"throwImmediately\" from exceptions and error events.\n  This control mechanism was used to stop a transfer of concurrent requests\n  from completing. This can now be handled by throwing the exception or by\n  cancelling a pool of requests or each outstanding future request individually.\n* Updated to \"GuzzleHttp\\Streams\" 3.0.\n    * `GuzzleHttp\\Stream\\StreamInterface::getContents()` no longer accepts a\n      `maxLen` parameter. This update makes the Guzzle streams project\n      compatible with the current PSR-7 proposal.\n    * `GuzzleHttp\\Stream\\Stream::__construct`,\n      `GuzzleHttp\\Stream\\Stream::factory`, and\n      `GuzzleHttp\\Stream\\Utils::create` no longer accept a size in the second\n      argument. They now accept an associative array of options, including the\n      \"size\" key and \"metadata\" key which can be used to provide custom metadata.\n\n\n## 4.2.2 - 2014-09-08\n\n* Fixed a memory leak in the CurlAdapter when reusing cURL handles.\n* No longer using `request_fulluri` in stream adapter proxies.\n* Relative redirects are now based on the last response, not the first response.\n\n## 4.2.1 - 2014-08-19\n\n* Ensuring that the StreamAdapter does not always add a Content-Type header\n* Adding automated github releases with a phar and zip\n\n## 4.2.0 - 2014-08-17\n\n* Now merging in default options using a case-insensitive comparison.\n  Closes https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/767\n* Added the ability to automatically decode `Content-Encoding` response bodies\n  using the `decode_content` request option. This is set to `true` by default\n  to decode the response body if it comes over the wire with a\n  `Content-Encoding`. Set this value to `false` to disable decoding the\n  response content, and pass a string to provide a request `Accept-Encoding`\n  header and turn on automatic response decoding. This feature now allows you\n  to pass an `Accept-Encoding` header in the headers of a request but still\n  disable automatic response decoding.\n  Closes https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/764\n* Added the ability to throw an exception immediately when transferring\n  requests in parallel. Closes https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/760\n* Updating guzzlehttp/streams dependency to ~2.1\n* No longer utilizing the now deprecated namespaced methods from the stream\n  package.\n\n## 4.1.8 - 2014-08-14\n\n* Fixed an issue in the CurlFactory that caused setting the `stream=false`\n  request option to throw an exception.\n  See: https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/769\n* TransactionIterator now calls rewind on the inner iterator.\n  See: https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/pull/765\n* You can now set the `Content-Type` header to `multipart/form-data`\n  when creating POST requests to force multipart bodies.\n  See https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/768\n\n## 4.1.7 - 2014-08-07\n\n* Fixed an error in the HistoryPlugin that caused the same request and response\n  to be logged multiple times when an HTTP protocol error occurs.\n* Ensuring that cURL does not add a default Content-Type when no Content-Type\n  has been supplied by the user. This prevents the adapter layer from modifying\n  the request that is sent over the wire after any listeners may have already\n  put the request in a desired state (e.g., signed the request).\n* Throwing an exception when you attempt to send requests that have the\n  \"stream\" set to true in parallel using the MultiAdapter.\n* Only calling curl_multi_select when there are active cURL handles. This was\n  previously changed and caused performance problems on some systems due to PHP\n  always selecting until the maximum select timeout.\n* Fixed a bug where multipart/form-data POST fields were not correctly\n  aggregated (e.g., values with \"&\").\n\n## 4.1.6 - 2014-08-03\n\n* Added helper methods to make it easier to represent messages as strings,\n  including getting the start line and getting headers as a string.\n\n## 4.1.5 - 2014-08-02\n\n* Automatically retrying cURL \"Connection died, retrying a fresh connect\"\n  errors when possible.\n* cURL implementation cleanup\n* Allowing multiple event subscriber listeners to be registered per event by\n  passing an array of arrays of listener configuration.\n\n## 4.1.4 - 2014-07-22\n\n* Fixed a bug that caused multi-part POST requests with more than one field to\n  serialize incorrectly.\n* Paths can now be set to \"0\"\n* `ResponseInterface::xml` now accepts a `libxml_options` option and added a\n  missing default argument that was required when parsing XML response bodies.\n* A `save_to` stream is now created lazily, which means that files are not\n  created on disk unless a request succeeds.\n\n## 4.1.3 - 2014-07-15\n\n* Various fixes to multipart/form-data POST uploads\n* Wrapping function.php in an if-statement to ensure Guzzle can be used\n  globally and in a Composer install\n* Fixed an issue with generating and merging in events to an event array\n* POST headers are only applied before sending a request to allow you to change\n  the query aggregator used before uploading\n* Added much more robust query string parsing\n* Fixed various parsing and normalization issues with URLs\n* Fixing an issue where multi-valued headers were not being utilized correctly\n  in the StreamAdapter\n\n## 4.1.2 - 2014-06-18\n\n* Added support for sending payloads with GET requests\n\n## 4.1.1 - 2014-06-08\n\n* Fixed an issue related to using custom message factory options in subclasses\n* Fixed an issue with nested form fields in a multi-part POST\n* Fixed an issue with using the `json` request option for POST requests\n* Added `ToArrayInterface` to `GuzzleHttp\\Cookie\\CookieJar`\n\n## 4.1.0 - 2014-05-27\n\n* Added a `json` request option to easily serialize JSON payloads.\n* Added a `GuzzleHttp\\json_decode()` wrapper to safely parse JSON.\n* Added `setPort()` and `getPort()` to `GuzzleHttp\\Message\\RequestInterface`.\n* Added the ability to provide an emitter to a client in the client constructor.\n* Added the ability to persist a cookie session using $_SESSION.\n* Added a trait that can be used to add event listeners to an iterator.\n* Removed request method constants from RequestInterface.\n* Fixed warning when invalid request start-lines are received.\n* Updated MessageFactory to work with custom request option methods.\n* Updated cacert bundle to latest build.\n\n4.0.2 (2014-04-16)\n------------------\n\n* Proxy requests using the StreamAdapter now properly use request_fulluri (#632)\n* Added the ability to set scalars as POST fields (#628)\n\n## 4.0.1 - 2014-04-04\n\n* The HTTP status code of a response is now set as the exception code of\n  RequestException objects.\n* 303 redirects will now correctly switch from POST to GET requests.\n* The default parallel adapter of a client now correctly uses the MultiAdapter.\n* HasDataTrait now initializes the internal data array as an empty array so\n  that the toArray() method always returns an array.\n\n## 4.0.0 - 2014-03-29\n\n* For information on changes and upgrading, see:\n  https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/blob/master/UPGRADING.md#3x-to-40\n* Added `GuzzleHttp\\batch()` as a convenience function for sending requests in\n  parallel without needing to write asynchronous code.\n* Restructured how events are added to `GuzzleHttp\\ClientInterface::sendAll()`.\n  You can now pass a callable or an array of associative arrays where each\n  associative array contains the \"fn\", \"priority\", and \"once\" keys.\n\n## 4.0.0.rc-2 - 2014-03-25\n\n* Removed `getConfig()` and `setConfig()` from clients to avoid confusion\n  around whether things like base_url, message_factory, etc. should be able to\n  be retrieved or modified.\n* Added `getDefaultOption()` and `setDefaultOption()` to ClientInterface\n* functions.php functions were renamed using snake_case to match PHP idioms\n* Added support for `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and\n  `GUZZLE_CURL_SELECT_TIMEOUT` environment variables\n* Added the ability to specify custom `sendAll()` event priorities\n* Added the ability to specify custom stream context options to the stream\n  adapter.\n* Added a functions.php function for `get_path()` and `set_path()`\n* CurlAdapter and MultiAdapter now use a callable to generate curl resources\n* MockAdapter now properly reads a body and emits a `headers` event\n* Updated Url class to check if a scheme and host are set before adding \":\"\n  and \"//\".

This\n  means that the redirect behavior of POST requests with custom bodies will not be the same as POST requests that use\n  POST fields or files (the latter is only used when emulating a form POST in the browser).\n* Lots of cleanup to CurlHandle::factory and RequestFactory::createRequest\n\n## 3.3.1 - 2013-03-10\n\n* Added the ability to create PHP streaming responses from HTTP requests\n* Bug fix: Running any filters when parsing response headers with service descriptions\n* Bug fix: OauthPlugin fixes to allow for multi-dimensional array signing, and sorting parameters before signing\n* Bug fix: Removed the adding of default empty arrays and false Booleans to responses in order to be consistent across\n  response location visitors.\n* Bug fix: Removed the possibility of creating configuration files with circular dependencies\n* RequestFactory::create() now uses the key of a POST file when setting the POST file name\n* Added xmlAllowEmpty to serialize an XML body even if no XML specific parameters are set\n\n## 3.3.0 - 2013-03-03\n\n* A large number of performance optimizations have been made\n* Bug fix: Added 'wb' as a valid write mode for streams\n* Bug fix: `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\Response::json()` now allows scalar values to be returned\n* Bug fix: Fixed bug in `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\Response` where wrapping quotes were stripped from `getEtag()`\n* BC: Removed `Guzzle\\Http\\Utils` class\n* BC: Setting a service description on a client will no longer modify the client's command factories.\n* BC: Emitting IO events from a RequestMediator is now a parameter that must be set in a request's curl options using\n  the 'emit_io' key. This was previously set under a request's parameters using 'curl.emit_io'\n* BC: `Guzzle\\Stream\\Stream::getWrapper()` and `Guzzle\\Stream\\Stream::getSteamType()` are no longer converted to\n  lowercase\n* Operation parameter objects are now lazy loaded internally\n* Added ErrorResponsePlugin that can throw errors for responses defined in service description operations' errorResponses\n* Added support for instantiating responseType=class responseClass classes. Classes must implement\n  `Guzzle\\Service\\Command\\ResponseClassInterface`\n* Added support for additionalProperties for top-level parameters in responseType=model responseClasses. These\n  additional properties also support locations and can be used to parse JSON responses where the outermost part of the\n  JSON is an array\n* Added support for nested renaming of JSON models (rename sentAs to name)\n* CachePlugin\n    * Added support for stale-if-error so that the CachePlugin can now serve stale content from the cache on error\n    * Debug headers can now added to cached response in the CachePlugin\n\n## 3.2.0 - 2013-02-14\n\n* CurlMulti is no longer reused globally.

HTML in a very easy way!\nThis is a fork of [PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser project](http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net/) but instead of string manipulation we use DOMDocument and modern php classes like \"Symfony CssSelector\".\n\n- PHP 7.0+ & 8.0 Support\n- PHP-FIG Standard\n- Composer & PSR-4 support\n- PHPUnit testing via Travis CI\n- PHP-Quality testing via SensioLabsInsight\n- UTF-8 Support (more support via \"voku/portable-utf8\")\n- Invalid HTML Support (partly ...)\n- Find tags on an HTML page with selectors just like jQuery\n- Extract contents from HTML in a single line\n\n\n### Install via \"composer require\"\n\n```shell\ncomposer require voku/simple_html_dom\ncomposer require voku/portable-utf8 # if you need e.g. UTF-8 fixed output\n```\n\n### Quick Start\n\n```php\nuse voku\\helper\\HtmlDomParser;\n\nrequire_once 'composer/autoload.php';\n\n...\n$dom = HtmlDomParser::str_get_html($str);\n// or \n$dom = HtmlDomParser::file_get_html($file);\n\n$element = $dom->findOne('#css-selector'); // \"$element\" === instance of \"SimpleHtmlDomInterface\"\n\n$elements = $dom->findMulti('.css-selector'); // \"$elements\" === instance of SimpleHtmlDomNodeInterface<int, SimpleHtmlDomInterface>\n\n$elementOrFalse = $dom->findOneOrFalse('#css-selector'); // \"$elementOrFalse\" === instance of \"SimpleHtmlDomInterface\" or false\n\n$elementsOrFalse = $dom->findMultiOrFalse('.css-selector'); // \"$elementsOrFalse\" === instance of SimpleHtmlDomNodeInterface<int, SimpleHtmlDomInterface> or false\n...\n\n```\n\n### Examples\n\n[github.com/voku/simple_html_dom/tree/master/example](https://github.com/voku/simple_html_dom/tree/master/example)\n\n###

Callers relying on the exception being thrown to detect invalid\n  URIs should catch the new exception.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Return `null` in caching stream size if remote size is `null`\n\n## 2.0.0 - 2021-06-30\n\nIdentical to the RC release.\n\n## 2.0.0@RC-1 - 2021-04-29\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Handle possibly unset `url` in `stream_get_meta_data`\n\n## 2.0.0@beta-1 - 2021-03-21\n\n### Added\n\n- PSR-17 factories\n- Made classes final\n- PHP7 type hints\n\n### Changed\n\n- When building a query string, booleans are represented as 1 and 0.\n\n### Removed\n\n- PHP < 7.2 support\n- All functions in the `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7` namespace\n\n## 1.8.1 - 2021-03-21\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Issue parsing IPv6 URLs\n- Issue modifying ServerRequest lost all its attributes\n\n## 1.8.0 - 2021-03-21\n\n### Added\n\n- Locale independent URL parsing\n- Most classes got a `@final` annotation to prepare for 2.0\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Issue when creating stream from `php://input` and curl-ext is not installed\n- Broken `Utils::tryFopen()` on PHP 8\n\n## 1.7.0 - 2020-09-30\n\n### Added\n\n- Replaced functions by static methods\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Converting a non-seekable stream to a string\n- Handle multiple Set-Cookie correctly\n- Ignore array keys in header values when merging\n- Allow multibyte characters to be parsed in `Message:bodySummary()`\n\n### Changed\n\n- Restored partial HHVM 3 support\n\n\n## [1.6.1] - 2019-07-02\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Accept null and bool header values again\n\n\n## [1.6.0] - 2019-06-30\n\n### Added\n\n- Allowed version `^3.0` of `ralouphie/getallheaders` dependency (#244)\n- Added MIME type for WEBP image format (#246)\n- Added more validation of values according to PSR-7 and RFC standards, e.g. status code range (#250, #272)\n\n### Changed\n\n- Tests don't pass with HHVM 4.0, so HHVM support got dropped. Other libraries like composer have done the same. (#262)\n- Accept port number 0 to be valid (#270)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed subsequent reads from `php://input` in ServerRequest (#247)\n- Fixed readable/writable detection for certain stream modes (#248)\n- Fixed encoding of special characters in the `userInfo` component of an URI (#253)\n\n\n## [1.5.2] - 2018-12-04\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Check body size when getting the message summary\n\n\n## [1.5.1] - 2018-12-04\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Get the summary of a body only if it is readable\n\n\n## [1.5.0] - 2018-12-03\n\n### Added\n\n- Response first-line to response string exception (fixes #145)\n- A test for #129 behavior\n- `get_message_body_summary` function in order to get the message summary\n- `3gp` and `mkv` mime types\n\n### Changed\n\n- Clarify exception message when stream is detached\n\n### Deprecated\n\n- Deprecated parsing folded header lines as per RFC 7230\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fix `AppendStream::detach` to not close streams\n- `InflateStream` preserves `isSeekable` attribute of the underlying stream\n- `ServerRequest::getUriFromGlobals` to support URLs in query parameters\n\n\nSeveral other fixes and improvements.\n\n\n## [1.4.2] - 2017-03-20\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Reverted BC break to `Uri::resolve` and `Uri::removeDotSegments` by removing\n  calls to `trigger_error` when deprecated methods are invoked.\n\n\n## [1.4.1] - 2017-02-27\n\n### Added\n\n- Rriggering of silenced deprecation warnings.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Reverted BC break by reintroducing behavior to automagically fix a URI with a\n  relative path and an authority by adding a leading slash to the path. It's only\n  deprecated now.\n\n\n## [1.4.0] - 2017-02-21\n\n### Added\n\n- Added common URI utility methods based on RFC 3986 (see documentation in the readme):\n  - `Uri::isDefaultPort`\n  - `Uri::isAbsolute`\n  - `Uri::isNetworkPathReference`\n  - `Uri::isAbsolutePathReference`\n  - `Uri::isRelativePathReference`\n  - `Uri::isSameDocumentReference`\n  - `Uri::composeComponents`\n  - `UriNormalizer::normalize`\n  - `UriNormalizer::isEquivalent`\n  - `UriResolver::relativize`\n\n### Changed\n\n- Ensure `ServerRequest::getUriFromGlobals` returns a URI in absolute form.\n- Allow `parse_response` to parse a response without delimiting space and reason.\n- Ensure each URI modification results in a valid URI according to PSR-7 discussions.\n  Invalid modifications will throw an exception instead of returning a wrong URI or\n  doing some magic.\n  - `(new Uri)->withPath('foo')->withHost('example.com')` will throw an exception\n    because the path of a URI with an authority must start with a slash \"/\" or be empty\n  - `(new Uri())->withScheme('http')` will return `'http://localhost'`\n\n### Deprecated\n\n- `Uri::resolve` in favor of `UriResolver::resolve`\n- `Uri::removeDotSegments` in favor of `UriResolver::removeDotSegments`\n\n### Fixed\n\n- `Stream::read` when length parameter <= 0.\n- `copy_to_stream` reads bytes in chunks instead of `maxLen` into memory.\n- `ServerRequest::getUriFromGlobals` when `Host` header contains port.\n- Compatibility of URIs with `file` scheme and empty host.\n\n\n## [1.3.1] - 2016-06-25\n\n### Fixed\n\n- `Uri::__toString` for network path references, e.g. `//example.org`.\n- Missing lowercase normalization for host.\n- Handling of URI components in case they are `'0'` in a lot of places,\n  e.g. as a user info password.\n- `Uri::withAddedHeader` to correctly merge headers with different case.\n- Trimming of header values in `Uri::withAddedHeader`. Header values may\n  be surrounded by whitespace which should be ignored according to RFC 7230\n  Section 3.2.4. This does not apply to header names.\n- `Uri::withAddedHeader` with an array of header values.\n- `Uri::resolve` when base path has no slash and handling of fragment.\n- Handling of encoding in `Uri::with(out)QueryValue` so one can pass the\n  key/value both in encoded as well as decoded form to those methods. This is\n  consistent with withPath, withQuery etc.\n- `ServerRequest::withoutAttribute` when attribute value is null.\n\n\n## [1.3.0] - 2016-04-13\n\n### Added\n\n- Remaining interfaces needed for full PSR7 compatibility\n  (ServerRequestInterface, UploadedFileInterface, etc.).\n- Support for stream_for from scalars.\n\n### Changed\n\n- Can now extend Uri.\n\n### Fixed\n- A bug in validating request methods by making it more permissive.\n\n\n## [1.2.3] - 2016-02-18\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Support in `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\CachingStream` for seeking forward on remote\n  streams, which can sometimes return fewer bytes than requested with `fread`.\n- Handling of gzipped responses with FNAME headers.\n\n\n## [1.2.2] - 2016-01-22\n\n### Added\n\n- Support for URIs without any authority.\n- Support for HTTP 451 'Unavailable For Legal Reasons.'\n- Support for using '0' as a filename.\n- Support for including non-standard ports in Host headers.\n\n\n## [1.2.1] - 2015-11-02\n\n### Changes\n\n- Now supporting negative offsets when seeking to SEEK_END.\n\n\n## [1.2.0] - 2015-08-15\n\n### Changed\n\n- Body as `\"0\"` is now properly added to a response.\n- Now allowing forward seeking in CachingStream.\n- Now properly parsing HTTP requests that contain proxy targets in\n  `parse_request`.\n- functions.php is now conditionally required.\n- user-info is no longer dropped when resolving URIs.\n\n\n## [1.1.0] - 2015-06-24\n\n### Changed\n\n- URIs can now be relative.\n- `multipart/form-data` headers are now overridden case-insensitively.\n- URI paths no longer encode the following characters because they are allowed\n  in URIs: \"(\", \")\", \"*\", \"!\", \"'\"\n- A port is no longer added to a URI when the scheme is missing and no port is\n  present.\n\n\n## 1.0.0 - 2015-05-19\n\nInitial release.\n\nCurrently unsupported:\n\n- `Psr\\Http\\Message\\ServerRequestInterface`\n- `Psr\\Http\\Message\\UploadedFileInterface`\n\n\n\n[1.6.0]:

parser model here follows the model in section\n[8.2.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/CR-html5-20121217/syntax.html#parsing)\nof the HTML5 specification, though we do not assume a networking layer.\n\n     [ InputStream ]    // Generic support for reading input.\n           ||\n      [ Scanner ]       // Breaks down the stream into characters.\n           ||\n     [ Tokenizer ]      // Groups characters into syntactic\n           ||\n    [ Tree Builder ]    // Organizes units into a tree of objects\n           ||\n     [ DOM Document ]     // The final state of the parsed document.\n\n\n## InputStream\n\nThis is an interface with at least two concrete implementations:\n\n- StringInputStream: Reads an HTML5 string.\n- FileInputStream: Reads an HTML5 file.\n\n## Scanner\n\nThis is a mechanical piece of the parser.\n\n## Tokenizer\n\nThis follows section 8.4 of the HTML5 spec. It is (roughly) a recursive\ndescent parser. (Though there are plenty of optimizations that are less\nthan purely functional.\n\n## EventHandler and DOMTree\n\nEventHandler is the interface for tree builders. Since not all\nimplementations will necessarily build trees, we've chosen a more\ngeneric name.\n\nThe event handler emits tokens during tokenization.\n\nThe DOMTree is an event handler that builds a DOM tree. The output of\nthe DOMTree builder is a DOMDocument.\n\n## DOMDocument\n\nPHP has a DOMDocument class built-in (technically, it's part of libxml.)\nWe use that, thus rendering the output of this process compatible with\nSimpleXML, QueryPath, and many other XML/HTML processing tools.\n\nFor cases where the HTML5 is a fragment of a HTML5 document a\nDOMDocumentFragment is returned instead.
