DATA RULES
	•	Remove all scraped data. Start clean.
	•	Keep bonnen and players.
	•	A day contains bonnen (not “rows”).
	•	A bon can contain multiple “rijen”.
	•	Players may NOT have identical names.
	•	A daily overview must NOT show people as icons/cards—only a simple summary list at the bottom that can be expanded and edited.
